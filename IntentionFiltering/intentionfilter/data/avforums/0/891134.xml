		<content>i was watching tv and my vizio vp50 shut off. no lights on or any indication of power. i unplugged it and plugged back in. any ideas where i can research and see if a component can be replaced? perhaps it's a component for the power that needs replaced. tv is 3 years old and out of warranty. paul parker, co</content>
