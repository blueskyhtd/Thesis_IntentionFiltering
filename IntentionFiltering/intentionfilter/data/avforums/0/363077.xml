		<content>hi there, i just bought the plasma tv samsung ps50c679. i saw in other samsung models that by activating the 100hz motion plus feature, you got this "soap opera" effect. now i'd like to get this effect on my tv and i donâ´t know if there is some way to achieve that on the ps50c679 (eigenschaften von ps50c679 | fernseher (plasma tv) von samsung ) i have really tried within the settings, but i didnâ´t get to something similar. does anybody knows how to do it? or even if it is possible? thank you very much!! raãºl.</content>
