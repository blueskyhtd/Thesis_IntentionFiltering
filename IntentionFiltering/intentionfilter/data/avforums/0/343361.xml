		<content>hello everyone, its more then 1 year since i have my samsung ps50c7700 plasma and i'm more then satisfied with it, however last week i went to a local store to check new tv's and they had this "video" effect that looked very nice. i have read on this and this seems to be caused by higher fresh rates. is there a setting i can turn this "video effect" on my tv? would love it on my blurays and sport events on tv. hope you guys can help.</content>
