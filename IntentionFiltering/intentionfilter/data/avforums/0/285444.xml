		<content>supposing to use vx100 with radiance xs, i put my vx100 in external scaler mode. reading the new vx300 review there is a part where the reviewer said that you have to turn off the frame interpolation to get the best result. i can't find this setting in my vx100 menu. if i go to signal menu i see what i attach. can someone help me? thanks</content>
