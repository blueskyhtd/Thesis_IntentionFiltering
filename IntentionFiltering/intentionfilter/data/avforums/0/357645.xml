		<content>hi. i have a 42" panasonic plasma which is displaying a vertical line of about 3-4mm right down the middle of the screen. i don't think it's screen burn as it's a line and not an image. does anyone have any experience of this? i've been told it's not a connection/signal issue as it still appears when i watch a dvd. the tv is less than 18 months old. any advice/suggestions would be appreciated. thanks!</content>
