		<content>my panasonic 50ut30b buzzes on bright images while i have the settings low for run in. if i increase the contrast or use dynamic mode the buzz is less noticable - everything i have read on plasma buzz suggests that it should buzz more at higher contrast levels, but mine is the opposite - does that sound normal</content>
