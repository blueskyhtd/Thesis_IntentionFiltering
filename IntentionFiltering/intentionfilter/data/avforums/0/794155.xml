		<content>hi, i noticed that pc world had a few 50" plasma for pretty reasonable prices around the â£700 mark i brought my current tv about 4 or 5 years ago, its the samsung everyone was buying then and one of the first with 1080p24, and it cost around the â£1800 mark i think. wondering if the entry level models from the big buys (panasonic, samsung, etc) compare well against older pricer models? the models i noticed was samsung ps41d550 and panasonic txp50u30b</content>
