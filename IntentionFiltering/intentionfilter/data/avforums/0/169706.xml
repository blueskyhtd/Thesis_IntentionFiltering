		<content>hi - i have just installed samsung ps63c7000 and connected it to bose t20 - all ok except i cant get sound out of the tv to play via bose - have tried in hdmi1 and hdmi2 - i have hdmi 1.4 cables - was hoping that either hdmi port 1 or 2 would work - especially with the arc feature on hdmi2. have built all the cables into the 'new wall' - didn't run audio digital/optical cable - any ideas? rjb</content>
