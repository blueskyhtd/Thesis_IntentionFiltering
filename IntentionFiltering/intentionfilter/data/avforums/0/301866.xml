		<content>hi, our plasma tv decided to stop working last night it has sound but no picture i have included a video of what it is doing #x202a;brokentv#x202c;rlm; - youtube we got the tv in november 2006 so its not that old. i thought i would ask on here first rather than call out an engineer so see if it is a easy fix and how might it might cost as if it is too expensive id much rather update to a newer tv. hopefully you are able to help</content>
