		<content>hey everyone, i have had my above set for about 4 months now. everything was great as far as i was concerned until the screen cracked in the middle. an engineer took it away and replaced the screen. everything seemed good again, untill i started to notice ir on it. i'm with sky and although the ir does go after a while i dont find the amount of time it takes as acceptable. i could be watching a film thats on a dark scene and i can still see the sky banner for anything from 5-10 minutes. is this acceptable? since i have already had it replaced, would i be able to demand a refund or a replacement tv. maybe the next model up? thanks graham</content>
