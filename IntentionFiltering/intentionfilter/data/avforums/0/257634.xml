		<content>hi, yesterday recieved my new plasma screen a techwood 42" job from curries. tested it with dvd and it looks fantastic, plugged in sky+ and video, video is ok. sky+ i'm having a nightmare with, some channels are lovely, others are really badly blocky, especially on grey's/black's. is this a general issue with plasma screens or is something wrong? and does anyone know the sky+ remote code for controlling the tv with the sky+ remote? thanks</content>
