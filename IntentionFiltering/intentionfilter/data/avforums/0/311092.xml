		<content>hi just recieved the above tv a few days ago but i feel the sound is quite "tinny" compared to the 7 year old plasma i've just replaced ... i quite like a lot of bass and ive looked in the sound menu etc and played around with settings etc but still sounds weak . ive tried the preset sound choices and the equaliser but still sounds poor to me . is there something im missing . thanks sorry im in the wrong section ... reposted in plasma thread .</content>
