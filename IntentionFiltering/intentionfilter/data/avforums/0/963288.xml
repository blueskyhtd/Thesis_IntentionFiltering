		<content>hi all ... recieved my samsung ps59d7005 two days ago, but im really missing this feature ! is it possible to enable "cinema smooth" in the service menu ? i play movieâ´s from a dlna server (serviio) and the option is greyd out under options ... i know that the tv wants a 24p signal before itâ´sactivated, but i read somewhere it was possible to enable it in the service menu, so it could be used for regular tv and mkv x264 movies ? hope someone can help me out :0) ps. i have tried to get an answer in the other threads, but no luck ...</content>
