		<content>i have a really old samsung le46n87bdr which is working fine for most channels but for some reason it wont pick up the bbc channels? when i autotune the first channel is itv and if i manually tune, it wont let me go down beyond channel 21 (bbc is 1 and 2). anyone had this kind of problem before? also noticed when it autotunes it starts at 21</content>
