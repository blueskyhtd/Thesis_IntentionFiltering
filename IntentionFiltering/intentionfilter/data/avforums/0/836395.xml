		<content>although they do make great plamsa tv's, i think the styling on most of their sets is still poor compared to the competition, even on the current range. the vt30 is the nicest though, but too expensive! i am getting the gt50 on monday, but i don't like the white fading effect on the front where the panasonic logo is, or the thin silver border around the panel. i will compromise on looks though, as i have always preferred the panasonic plasmas overall quality. i do think that the styling of the gt30 is a massive improvement from any previous models though and way better than the ugly st30 with its wide frame and cheap looking bevel effect. it looks like a throwback from the 90's.</content>
