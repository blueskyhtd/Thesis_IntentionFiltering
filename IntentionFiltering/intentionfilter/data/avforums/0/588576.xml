		<title>strange combination of pcb's in 42 samsung</title>

		<content>i was given a 42' samsung (ps42b451bwxxu) as it wasnt working correctly, the last 3' on the right hand side of the screen dont show any sings of life from top to bottom, a bit of research  the samsung service manual for the unit suggested that i replace the 'e buffer board', i've opend the unit to confirm the correct part number etc, strange thing is, the main pcb is for a 50' plasma (part no. bn94 02837a)..i cannot find anything saying this is compatable with the 42' model, i suspect someone has been in the unit b4, does anyone think this in itself could be causing the issue or even have damaged the 'e buffer board' ? all help appreciated. cheers, gnb....</content>
