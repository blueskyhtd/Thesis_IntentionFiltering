		<content>i have a g20b and it is a year old and whilst watching virgin over hdmi roughly 20 horizontal blue lines 5 cm apart and maybe 2mm width are slowly coming down my screen (at a rate of maybe 1 a second)!!! on any input (including the 3 possible hdmi inputs i have, viera cast, and anolouge) there still there. does any one have any ideas what this is and more importantly can i fix it???? (have tried leaving it of for an hour and also removing all but one inputs, resetting to factory conditions)</content>
