		<content>has anyone ever had an issue with their tv interfering with their wireless internet router? i bought a samsung ps43d490 yesterday, and since then it's been interfering with my internet. it basically makes my router think there is no phone line and no internet. if i turn the tv off then it's fine. it doesn't matter where in the house i have the router, or which router i use (ive tried two different routers). i've call samsung who haven't been much help. im at a loss and its really annoying me! if this cannot he resolved then they can have the tv back!</content>
