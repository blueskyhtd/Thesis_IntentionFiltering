		<content>splashed out â£3200 3 years ago on an lx5090, been mildly impressed with picture quality during that time. my father in law has purchased a â£600 samsung and the pq is a million times better than mine - it's awesome, super sharp. seriously ****** off man, what the hell is all that about?? some of you will no doubt say that it's imperative to get it isf'd but, why? as if paying out over â£3k on a tv is not enough, i have to spend a further â£300 on making it look as good as a â£600 set. not happy man. waste of money, case in point. rant over.</content>
