		<content>i have a panasonic viera tx-p42u30b and ever since i turned it on there has been a high pitch buzzing almost a squeal. the only time you don't hear it is when the volume is loud enough to drown it out. it is becoming the only thing i hear because it is annoying me so much. what is it?</content>
