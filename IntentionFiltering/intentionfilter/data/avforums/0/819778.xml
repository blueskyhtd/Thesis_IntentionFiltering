		<content>hi, i have a pioneer pdp 436 display. when disconnected from the media reciever i would expect a red and blue flashing square on the screen but i get nothing but the red and blue led's flashing near the switch. i am recieving the new media reciever later, but wanted to start looking at the faults now. i did buy this as faulty just so you know. any guidance would be appreciated.</content>
