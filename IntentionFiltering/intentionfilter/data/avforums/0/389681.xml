		<content>dear users, i am a proud owner of a panasonic 50" vt30....love the display and its capabilities but....in some movies/tv shows (i think depends on mixing/mastering of the video) i get annoyed by the juddering.... - im sitting like 3meters away from my 50", is this too close and therefore i see it much clearly? - is there a way to make it less visible? hope you can help me out. cheers, mitch.</content>
