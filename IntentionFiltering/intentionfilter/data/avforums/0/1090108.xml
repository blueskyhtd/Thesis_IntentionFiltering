		<content>i have had my g20 since july 2010 and have not had a single problem with it.... until now. the latest firmware update has caused the tv to reboot every few minutes but only when watching freeview. watching via freesat is not affected. i have tried a factory reset and this will work for a while but the rebooting eventually returns. any suggestions please. jonuk</content>
