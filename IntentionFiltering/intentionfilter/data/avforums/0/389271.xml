		<content>hi, just bought my lg 50pz550t 50" plasma 4 days ago and it's been perfect untill today when it switched itself off this morning and then did the same again this afternoon! as soon as it turned itself off i switched it back on by the remote and all was fine?? but to do this twice in 1 day when it's just 4 days old is a bit odd isn't it? thanks.</content>
