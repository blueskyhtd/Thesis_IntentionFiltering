		<content>if i get a onkyo tx-sr608 amp (which is arc compliant) and connect it to hdmi 2 on the panasonic. and then connect my bluray player, media player and sky hd box to hdmi 1, 3  4, would the following happen:- 1) all audio played into the tv from the devices go straight through to the onkyo unchanged? ie: it would get the dts-hd, dts, dolby 5.1 etc audio? 2) the tv would output stereo sound? this would be great, as basically the audio for what ever you're watching on the tv would be fed to your amp. i've got a feeling i heard that, although the above setup would seem to make sense, that it doesn't work this way? and the hdmi (arc) from the tv to the amp would only send stereo in the above examples?!</content>
