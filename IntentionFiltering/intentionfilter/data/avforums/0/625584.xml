		<content>i'm trying to get my laptop to output to the tv with no joy. i connect the laptop with vga cable direct to the vga computer input but the pc channel on the tv shows a "no input signal" error and the laptop does not recognise that an external display device i.e. the tv is attached. i've tried another laptop -same problem. i've tried a vga to composite connection -same problem. i would be extremely grateful for any ideas. regards. r</content>
