		<content>hi guys, i have a samsung ps51d8000 and was just tinkering with my picture settings whilst i was on the xbox dashboard. i turned on 'game' mode and whilst i can't remember what the default cell light is for this mode, i noticed that no matter what number i chose from 9 onwards, the light did not get any brighter??? this isn't necessarily an issue as 9 in 'game' mode seems more than enough so i can only assume that this mode possibly maxes it to this number behind the scenes but i was wondering whether any of you people had also noticed this? i'm not a tv whizz so please forgive me if i've missed something!!! cheers.</content>
