		<content>hi the buzzing noise is louder on my 55 inch vt30 compared to my 42 inch pz800 plasma which i can only hear when i?m standing next to the pz800 when the tv volume is low on the vt30 i can hear the buzzing noise from where i?m sitting about 10 feet away? i can also hear the buzzing noise level going up and down sometimes on the vt30? appreciate any comments! thanks</content>
