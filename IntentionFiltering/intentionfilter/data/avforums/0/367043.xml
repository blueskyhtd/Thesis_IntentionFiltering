		<content>just sharing my experience. my samsung 3d ps50c680g5kxxu has died after 6 months - sound, no picture, responds to remote, meaning the y-sus or z-sus boards have blown. dixons has asked to talk to samsung, and samsung to dixons - would obviously get repaired until 1 year is over. â£1,000 3d tv for 1 year, with no hope after- avoid, and buy a sony or panasonic - most importantly, buy with extended warranty!!!</content>
