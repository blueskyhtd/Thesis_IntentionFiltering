		<content>does anyone know how to detune the digital channels? both freesat and freeview. i don't watch live broadcast tv anymore and would like to save myself the license fee (yeah i know they are a pain in the backside once you do that but i will deal with that when it comes). i don't think it's enough cutting the aerial cable at the wall as if you get any signal whatsoever they will nab you for it. edit: nevermind. i figured it out. you have to auto tune with the aerial disconnected whereupon it will find no channels and you can leave it like that. for analog i had to keep the aerial connected and make sure all the channels were de-tuned before disconnecting it.</content>
