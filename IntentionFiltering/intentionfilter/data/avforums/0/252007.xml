		<content>hi. my plasma is just over a year old and it's suddenly encountered a drastic colour change problem where the black colour has changed to red. i've rang up the warranty company, curry's whateverhappens (before you ask, i bought it from there because it was a very good price at the time!) who said theyre going to take the tv away for 2-3 weeks! so i was just wondering if anyone knows a fix before it gets sent away.</content>
