		<content>i have had my panasonic 37x10 for a couple of years now and am having problems with image retention from those flipping channels with static logos and qvc! thankfully, it does disappear after a while but is annoying watching programmes whilst it is still showing! is there anything i can do to resolve this? i have had a look at pixelprotector and wondered whether this is any good? it does seem to be a lot of hassle though? any advice would be ever so much appreciated.</content>
