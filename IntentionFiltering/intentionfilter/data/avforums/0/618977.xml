		<content>hi everyone, can anyone help me out there? bought a panny g30 50 inch last week. what's going on with skin tones?? there is a very noticeable "blurring" every time a character turns their head. i previously had a g10 and noticed the same issue, albeit to a lesser degree. can anyone tell me what this is, will it go away through time, is their an ideal picture setting to minimise it? any replies greatly appreciated</content>
