		<content>i very stupidly cleaned my lg 50" plasma screen with an oven cleaner fluid, and now i have smudges and traces of fluid that seem to be engraved in the screen. it seems to have seeped right through as i can't remove them. i know it was stupid now, but i just didn't know at the time! i bought it second hand and it didn't come with a manual, and now i feel so annoyed and terribly frustrated. is there anything i can do to repair this? any help/advice would be tremendously appreciated. thank you. holly</content>
