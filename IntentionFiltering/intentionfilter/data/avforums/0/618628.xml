		<content>hello: i have recently purchased the lg 60pz550tv...it is great, but i have one small problem...the screen cuts off just the smallest bit of picture on the sides and top...not much at all, but enough to cut off, say, a letter or two of a title or headline...is there a way to adjust this? i have looked through the manual (really) and haven't found the answer...thanks a lot, steve</content>
