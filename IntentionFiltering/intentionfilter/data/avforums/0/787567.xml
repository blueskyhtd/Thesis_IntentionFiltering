		<content>hi all, i have recently bought a panasonic tx-p42s30b and currently have it wired to my bt homehub. i can access the onboard internet features fine, but can't seem to make any media servers appear on the tv - i have tried twonky and wild media - both can detect the tv, but the tv never seems to show any sign of recognising the presence of a media server?? any suggestions for will it work/how can i get it to work?? i'm truly stumped...</content>
