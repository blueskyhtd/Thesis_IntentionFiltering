		<content>as there seems to be quite a few of people across all three threads for each model type with this green tinge problem, i thought it might be a bit more productive to unify it all into one thread. i bought my p50st30 2 days ago and can clearly see the green tinge and it can clearly be seen in the below pictures. called panasonic and spoke to a guy called simon who said i should replace the tv and that he has never heard of the problem. not sure i believe him.</content>
