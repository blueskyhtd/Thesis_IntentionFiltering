		<content>so.... had my tv a while now, figured i should probably at least try to calibrate it. have sky-hd  popcorn hour running through amp on hdmi2 (mainly because it means i only have to run a single cable and hdmi2 works arc) i also have xbox 360 via component and freesat (built in). i want to calibrate using my pch, which has options for 0-255 colourspace. don't think any of my other sources do. so my questions is do i set the pch to 0-255 colourspace and calibrate using that, or leave it on 16?235?</content>
