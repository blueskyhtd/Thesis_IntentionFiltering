		<content>before i bought my 3d tv i was all excited, i watched 3d movies on the sky 3d channel, i downloaded the bit of 3d we all got excited the first time we watched a christmas carol in 3d, avatar 3d was quite good, but if i'm honest i think it was just a bit of a gimmick, i cant be bothered to put the glasses on these days, i would rather just watch a good movie that is nice and bright without all the hassle of the glasses, does anyone else feel like this, or are you still enjoying your 3d tv.</content>
