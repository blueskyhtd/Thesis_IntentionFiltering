		<content>the cooling fans in my panny plasma are thick with dust. although i regularly vacuum the grills, i can't get to the fans themselves. can i safely get to them and give them a vacuum by taking the screws off at the back, or is this not advisable? is there another way to do it? thanks in advance for your help</content>
