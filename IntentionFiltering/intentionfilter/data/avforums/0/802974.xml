		<content>seeing as the owners thread is getting long, and addressing a wide variety of issues, i thought it might be useful to start a dedicated settings thread. for example, what settings are people using to run in the set to avoid (hopefully) potential screen burn problems later. the only changes i made to the out of the box settings (for the run-in) were - dynamic mode off - turned down contrast to mid way. - everything else was mid way out of the box. any suggestions for settings? also, i notice there isn't an accurate numerical counter for settings, just a bar. i guess this makes it a bit harder to share settings. (or am i missing something) so, what settings are you using?</content>
