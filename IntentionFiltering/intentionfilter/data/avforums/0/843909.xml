		<content>i am not sure if this has been covered before in the forum, but i am noticing that in certain conditions, commentators etc., seem to have a very slight black edge to the image. it is barely perceptible but once noticed, it becomes irritating. i am generally delighted with the picture, except for this issue. my question is, is this normal? if not, what can i do to eradicate it? the viewing mode is, normal, with brightness and contrast at about 50% and cats off. any advice would be much appreciated. bill</content>
