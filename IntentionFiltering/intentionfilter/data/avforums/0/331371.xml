		<content>hi, just noticed by chance that i have a burned in image on my plasma in the top right corner saying "press" which is about 2" tall and 3 wide. not sure where it came from but i can just about see it on a fully white screen and a yellow screen and the colour is slightly dark... like a very slight shade of grey. i don't run my plasma at very high brightness so i am not to happy that i have a burn in image now but is there any way to fix this? it must have been there a while i suppose and i hope i learn to ignore it but i really didnt think plasmas had much of a burn in issue any more</content>
