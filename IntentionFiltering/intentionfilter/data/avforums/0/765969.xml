		<content>hi, i have the pioneer 507xd. i play my pc blu-ray player through the hdmi port. all of a sudden the hdmi would no longer show a picture. i have tried inputs 3 and 4. and i have also tried other equipment such as my sonyhd camcorder directly, including a different hdmi cable. input 3 is enabled in the settings menu too. my nvidia control panel detects my tv so a connection is happening (i think) just no picture. it is now 3yrs old. and have only started using the hdmi ports recently. does anybody have any ideas? pioneer want â£160 exvat just for a call out. minus labour and parts!! i really appreciate your help.</content>
