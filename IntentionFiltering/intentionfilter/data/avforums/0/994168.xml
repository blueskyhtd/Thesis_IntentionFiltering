		<content>those of you with buzzing sets, is your tv wall mounted? those of you without a buzz, is your tv stand mounted? i only have until tomorrow to decided if i want to return my tv to the suppliers for a refund (28 days after purchase). they don't have anymore in stock and won't be getting anymore, so a swap out is not an option. i've spoken to a panasonic service centre who advised that they have solved the buzzing on a number of these units that were walled mounted, by fitting a small spacer between the bracket and the tv, something like a plastic washer. not in all cases has this solved the problem, but with quite a few. i'm going to try it tonight on my 55vt30 and will let you know the outcome. has anyone tried this already with or without success? thanks.</content>
