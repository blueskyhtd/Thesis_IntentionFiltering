		<content>i can get a panasonic tx-p42s30 plasma from a local retailer for â£545 including the 5 year warranty, plus they also offer a tv swap out service. is this any better than the normal panasonic warranty? is the swap out service really worth while? i have a spare tv to use should any new tv fail.. cheers.</content>
