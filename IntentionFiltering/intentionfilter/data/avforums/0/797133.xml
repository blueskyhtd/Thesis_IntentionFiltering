		<content>hi i've had this tv for a few months now and so have finally decided to ask your opinion on what my issue may be. when watching sky channels or sky hd the picture leaves a slight pixelated trail behind fairly fast moving images. i say fast moving images but it could be a fairly slow panning shot. is this what is meant by ghosting? i thought this tv was good for not doing that? it doesn't do it when playing blurays through my home cinema system. could this be a sky reception issue? my input 1 signal strength is full and the quality is a tiny bit off of full. not sure if this matters but my input 2 signal strength is next to nothing and the signal 2 quality is about 3/4 full. any ideas? thanks in advance</content>
