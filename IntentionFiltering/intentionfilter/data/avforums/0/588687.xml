		<content>hi, i have a problem with samsung ps50c7000. blu ray movies recreating 3d (with pc by power dvd) options 3d (checkerboard) i only appear at a max resolution of 1680x1050 which makes watching the image in a small window on the side of my big white empty areas which completely distorts the view. why hd 1920x1080 i can not launch any videos (such as resident evil 3d ~> 40gb)? it may have something to do with the fact that i do not have hdmi 1.4 only 1.3? has anyone had this problem?</content>
