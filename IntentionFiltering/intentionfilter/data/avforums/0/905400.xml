		<content>this is a copy of a letter i sent to panasonic after a recent telephone call to customer care , i think you should call yourselves "customer don't care". the representative i spoke to had an attitude which bordered on rudeness. as a result of this conversation , i will never purchase another panasonic product again and i will make my opinion heard to any others who may be contemplating a panasonic purchase. i don't care what anybody says , a $3,000 tv (viera th-50pz80a 50" (127cm) full-hd digital plasma tv )shouldn't need $500 spent on it after 18 months to keep it going. that is a bad product , i agree that the normal warranty period has expired but to be told " you should have purchased the extended warranty" has only added insult to injury. i will post copies of this letter all over the internet to serve as a warning to others as to what panasonic thinks is a fair life span of a top end product. i don't think anyone else will agree with panasonic "customer(don't)care". i am 48 years old, and this is the worst purchase i have ever made to date.i would have expected my product replaced with a new one that is not defected or to be offered new parts(main board)from panasonic or at least sympathy.</content>
