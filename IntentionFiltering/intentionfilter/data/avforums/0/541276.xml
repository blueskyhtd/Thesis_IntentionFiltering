		<content>i bought a panasonic viera txp46g20 from richer sounds 3 weeks ago but i have only used it 3 times since then as have been decorating. i have plugged it in tonight and pressed the on/off button but the set does not switch on. the screnn flashes like it is about to start but then the green light on the front is replaced by a red light. this red light flashes eight times then stops for about 3 seconds before repeating the sequence. what does this mean?? i have unplugged and switched on and off a few times and the same thing happens.</content>
