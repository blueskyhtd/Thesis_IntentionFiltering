		<content>hi all! if you own one of these, can you please advise me what the sound is like in a normal living environment (ie living room)? i was listening to one in richer sounds and thought it sounded tinny. i will try and get to listen to one of these in a demo room to see if it was down to it being in the store. i did like the picture and the more natural colours though</content>
