		<content>okay i'll throw this question out there. should plasmas be mounted above radiators or above fireplaces. in a lot of the promotional material you see the happy couple sitting by a roaring fire with a plasma (usually switched off) mounted on the chimney flu. i'm currently working out the best place to mount my plasma and there are two options. 1 is above a 1m double rad and the other other is on a bare wall. my gut feal tell me mounting it above the rad is a bad idea ?</content>
