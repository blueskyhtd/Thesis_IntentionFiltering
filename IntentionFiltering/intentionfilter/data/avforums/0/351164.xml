		<content>my panasonic th-37px60b has served me fine until tonight. there was a popping noise and now only the left half of the screen is working. then there's a thin, incomplete vertical green line, the third quarter solid black, right hand quarter solid white. is this a major fault ? not worth replacing ? it was purchased from ask in london in december 2006 and i didn't take out any extended warranty. any advice would be much appreciated.</content>
