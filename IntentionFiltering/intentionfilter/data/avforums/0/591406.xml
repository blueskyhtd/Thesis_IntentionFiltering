		<content>someone gave me a pdp-504pu / pdp-5040hd without the receiver. i found a pdp-r03u on craigslist without reading that they might not work together. will this receiver work with my display? the problem i'm having is that when i have the system cables connected and i plug the power cable for the receiver into the wall, the standby light on the tv turns off and won't turn on. any suggestions?</content>
