		<content>hi, i have just purchased the panasonic viera p42gt30b. box seemed ok but on unpacking have found the remote loose in the box not even in a bag or anything. is this normal? i'm worried it may be a refurb. some of the other bits look like they have been thrown in with the instructions too whilst others are neatly shrink-wrapped. should i worry about it? thanks for any advice.</content>
