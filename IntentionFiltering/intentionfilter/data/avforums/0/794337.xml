		<content>recently my panasonic th42pz70b tv has developed an issue with small green lines appearing when light coloured screens are displayed, but it seems fine on darker colours. i don#8217;t know what the issue is so haven#8217;t had much luck on google. picture attached#8230;#8230;let me know if you know what it might be. note its not the darker green bar across the top, i think that was normal.</content>
