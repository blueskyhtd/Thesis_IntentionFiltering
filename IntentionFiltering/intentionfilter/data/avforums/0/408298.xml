		<content>hi there. had this set for a couple of months without issue. today though there are real issues with the sound. every few minutes the volume goes completely off. a few secs later the sound comes back again only a lot louder. this happens on all channels from what i can see. i have turned off the auto volume leveler in the menu and that made no difference turning power of then on again makes no difference. help</content>
