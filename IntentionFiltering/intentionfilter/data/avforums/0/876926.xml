		<content>hi. i have recently started renting movies and have noticed that a lot of the movies have letterboxing. now, i usually wouldn't mind this but because my new tv is a plasma, i don't want to risk screen burn/ir. i am running blu-ray discs on my ps3. i know there is some way to at least make the letterboxing lighter so there is less risk but i don't know how. can anyone help me get rid of letterboxing/making it brighter on my panasonic tx-p42u30 on ps3? thanks alot</content>
