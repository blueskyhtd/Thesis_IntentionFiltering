		<content>my panasonic txp50g20 has a background buzzing noise which although not to loud can be heard sometimes over the tv programme. set is 7-8 months old. just had currys take it away for repair and it's come back(9days later) exactly the same. is this a normal problem and should i go back to them. the logik tv they lent me while repair was ongoing was silent! any comments would be appreciated thanks</content>
