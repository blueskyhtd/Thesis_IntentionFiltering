		<content>my th42px60b is coming up to 3 years old and has so far been very well-behaved. this week my ailing thomson sky+hd box was replaced with a new amstrad; the pana has since started to go into a regular switching on and off cycle in freeview mode though the problem seems to resolve itself when i switch the sky box on (from standby). it seems too much of a coincidence...any thoughts, similar experiences?</content>
