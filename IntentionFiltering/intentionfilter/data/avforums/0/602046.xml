		<content>whilst watching hd freeview on my lg 50'' every 15-60 seconds i get a very brief black screen, similar to the shutter on a slr camera, or the blink of an eye. it doesnt happen on blu ray, or my ps3 games. i have retuned, checked settings, reset tv to factory settings, no cure yet. any ideas?</content>
