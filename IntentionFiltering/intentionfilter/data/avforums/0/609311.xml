		<content>i know this has been mentioned before, but have any of the retailers/installers/calibrators worked out a way of persuading the 436 panel to accept an input other than the media receiver via dvi? i imagine the media box sends some sort of signal down the dvi cable to remind the panel of it's presence.</content>
