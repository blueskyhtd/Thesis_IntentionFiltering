		<content>hi i recently bought a panny 50s20 and freeview website says i should be able to receive hd channels from april this year but i can't seem to get them. on the other digital channels my signal strength and quality are at about 8 so i think the aerial is ok. i have tried re scanning for channels but they don't appear on my channel list. does anyone have any ideas? am i doing anything wrong? any suggestions would be appreciated. thank you</content>
