		<content>i've just received a lg 50pk950 and have discovered lip sync problems. i'm using the tv's own built-in speakers, and i have observed the problem with cable tv, both with the analog and digital tuner. i have the same issue with cabled network playback trying with a wide variety of file types. the audio is ~0,5 seconds early. is there any menu option where i can delay the audio? if not, what can i do?</content>
