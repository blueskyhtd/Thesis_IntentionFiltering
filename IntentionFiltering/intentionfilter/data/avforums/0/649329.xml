		<content>hi, after issues with lcd tv's, i made the switch to plasma. everything was fine (bar a few phosphor trails on certain things) and then i started getting some xbox 360 time in. been playing rdr recently and have now noticed that whenever i pan the camera around, the background, erm...ghosts? best way to describe it is the picture can't keep up when i pan around. it almost looks like i'm looking at a 3d picture without 3d glasses on. everything goes blurry. if i pan slowly, it's fine. as soon as i pan quickly, it becomes an issue, so it's a nightmare in fps games at the moment. was playing mass effect 2 last night and with a couple of characters on the screen, when i was panning the camera, it looked as if the characters had doubled up. i can try and film it if people don't know what i'm talking about, lol.</content>
