		<content>despite the negativity with green tinge fault i decided to take the risk with this set and purchased the panny 46gt30 tv + bluray + glasses + 5yr warranty. could anyone answer the following questions, please: 1) the bluray player apparently needs a special cable to render 3d, what is the lead? jl were trying to sell to me for â£40, i am sure it is much cheaper elsewhere e.g. amazon/ebay. 2) apparently the set comes with star wars triology, apparently this is only 2d, is there any offers direct with panasonic for 3d bluray (e.g. avatar)? 3) if i download a 3d demo, will it stream ok from laptop to tv - hdmi to hdmi?</content>
