		<content>my lg plasma tv is not powering on via the original remote control or the cable remote control, however when i touch the power button at the base of the tv, it responds and turns on, but now when i turn off the tv by hitting the power button on either remote, it turns off and not on. this is an urgent situation and i cannot figure out what is wrong. if anyone can assist i would greatly appreciate it.</content>
