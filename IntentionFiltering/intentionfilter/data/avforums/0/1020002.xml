		<content>hi i have a pioneer pdp 434pe and recently bought a used replacement r04e media receiver cable. however the standard pda-h01 cable works on the dvi side but as soon as you plug in the control cable the whole thing shuts down. the pioneer manual for my tv talks of a system cable (3 m) (adf1021). can anyone tell me if this is the same cable?</content>
