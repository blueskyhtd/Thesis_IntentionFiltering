		<content>good day, i heard about this forum from a friend and hopefully you guys will be able to provide me some help, because i almost went mental this weekend. i just bought a panasonic 42c3 plasma tv and when i tried to connect it to my pc it did not work. i bought a minihdmi - hdmi adapter, hdmi cable. basically everything i need to get the job done. when i try to connect to it with my pc it will not find it. i should specify that the video card i am trying to connect the plasma is an asus nvidia gtx470, and the operating system is windows 7 on 64 bit. hopefully you can help me out of this jam. thank you for your time.</content>
