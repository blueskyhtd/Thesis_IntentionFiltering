		<content>hi guys new tv arrived( panasonic gt30) today, noticed on a few channels we are getting small square pixaling on the top right of the screen, and on outer edges very faint lines which seems to come and go, any ideas , also noticed when i switch on the virgin v+ box it comes up with 1080i/50hz input i thought the tv was a 600hz</content>
