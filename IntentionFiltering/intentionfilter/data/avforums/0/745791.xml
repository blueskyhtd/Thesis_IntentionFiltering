		<content>i have acquired a panasonic th42pz81 and am quite pleased with it but one small gremlin in the works is bugging me. the tv is plugged into a sony rht-g900 [all in one stand/sound system] which has a ps3 and xbox 360 plugged into it  everything is connected via hdmi. occasionally when i switch to hdmi1 which is the channel the stand is on  power on the ps3 or xbox the colours of red and blue are swapped. simply turning either console off then on again solves it but i was wondering if anyone has ever come across this and knows of a solution ?</content>
