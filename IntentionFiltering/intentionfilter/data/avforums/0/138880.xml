		<content>hi i have just bought a tx-p50c3b to replace my 4yo th-42px80. i ordered the tv for â£399 which seemed like a bargain, it will be connected to a nas running whs2011 via hdmi. i have not found a lot of info on the new tv other than a few reviews which are not really that encouraging. the old tv was great but when i was offered â£350 it seemed like a no brainer to change it for a new bigger set for only â£49. i sit about 10 feet from the tv in a fairly dark room  it will be connected to the nas, skyhd, xbox360  sony s380br (both barely used) via an hdmi switch. i did like the look of the tx-p50g30b at â£549 in currys but it is now out of stock  i would have had difficulty convincing the wife on the extra â£150. has anyone any idea how the picture quality will compare with my old set, have i made a mistake? thanks andrew</content>
