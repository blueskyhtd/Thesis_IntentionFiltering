		<content>two days before christmas half way through motd and the screen makes a funny chirp noise, turns off and i#8217;m left with a blinking red light (x2 blinks). it#8217;s under warranty so no worries there (fingers crossed) but any ideas what it can be? and how long to repair #8211; is it a house visit or a send away? (please, its christmas!) thanks in advance</content>
