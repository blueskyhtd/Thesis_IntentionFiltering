		<content>hi all, just got my panasonic gt30 and am giving it a 150 hour run in but would like to calibrate it after. i know there are a couple of good dvds out there but i don't actually have a dvd player believe it or not! are there any options out there like a video file that could be played off usb or a set of image slides and accompanying pdf guide to follow? just want a non-dvd solution thanks russ</content>
