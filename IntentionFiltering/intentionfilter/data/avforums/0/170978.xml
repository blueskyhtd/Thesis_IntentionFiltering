		<content>hi this morning the tv made a pop sound and the screen went blank. audio could still be heard. i removed the back panel and tested the fuses. the 4ah fuse had blown. i replaced the fuse with 3.1ah (the psu board indicates use fuse between 2.5ah - 4ah). i replaced the cover panel and powered up the tv, i heard the usual 'click' sound when initially powering up, i switch on and the standby light goes from red, to amber to green. it stays on green for a few seconds and then goes back to red. i switch on again and it then only goes from red - amber. can anyone offer any assistance please? many thanks in advance.</content>
