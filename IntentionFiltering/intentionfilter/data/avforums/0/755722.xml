		<content>hello, i have a panasonic g20. after watching movies on a tv channel for an entire afternoon, the logo now appears almost permanently ? it?s especially visible with gray gradients. in order to get rid of it, i played the toy story blu-ray more than twenty times. i also ran the famous white scrolling bar for more than twenty hours. unfortunately, the channel logo is still there ? actually, i haven?t noticed any difference between before and after my attempts. is there anything i can do? thanks!</content>
