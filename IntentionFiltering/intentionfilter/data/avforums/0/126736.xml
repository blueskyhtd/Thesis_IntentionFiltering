		<content>hi, i bought ?viera th-p50u30d? 2 days back. i see an issue with ?brightness?. it either increase or decrease a bit (noticeably) during scenes changeovers.it doesn't happen for all scenes but for some. i read about ?picture mode? in manual - it says ?contrast?, ?black? and ?color? reproduction happens in ?cinema? mode. hence, i tried setting to ?true cinema? mode where no revision happen. but, no luck. the ?brightness? change is still visible during few scenes changeovers.. i can say i see something like this video. not this much, but noticeable! is this how it works? thanks in advance for your inputs... - dilip</content>
