		<content>so, i have a new lg tv as listed in title and a ps3 i noticed when i watch a blu ray or dvd via ps3 (and monster hdmi), and i press enter on the lg remote, it says 1080i and not 1080p??? why is this and how to i get the 1080p picture.....? kind of confused as i assumed all blu rays played 1080p??? it also says 1080i when watching hd satellite (but that is hooked up via monster component cables)</content>
