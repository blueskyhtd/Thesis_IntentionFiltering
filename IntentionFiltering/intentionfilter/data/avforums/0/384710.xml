		<content>i went to see the pv500cab in currys today with a view of getting one. i have been put off because it has a very loud buzz coming from the rear. the pioneer had less but the philips was awful. the 50" panasonic (had a 30 in the model) had less buzz than the pv500. noise is a problem for me. i hate any noise that shouldn't be there. i don't think the pv500 is an option now</content>
