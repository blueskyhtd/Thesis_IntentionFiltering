		<content>hi all, i am looking to move into an open plan kitchen/lounge property and just wondering, if having my beloved plasma (pio 5090) next to kitchen can damage its screen or inside electronics? i would rather not take risks, if you know what i mean... any advice is appreciated. cheers.</content>
