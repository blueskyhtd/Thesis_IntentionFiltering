		<content>hi all, i have a 2 year old lg 42pq6000 plasma tv that has developed a strange fault over the last month or 2. it has started to show a pinkish haze in the top left hand section of the screen (not all the time). i don't know if this is interference or not. i normally notice it when there is or has been very bright colours on the screen. or when i'm playing my xbox and, for example, i am playing a football game and the score bar on the top left is very faintly left in a pink haze after the screen changes to another area. very hard to describe amd i'm probably not doing a very good job!! could the power and hdmi, scart, antena cable etc be too close together? does it need re-gassing or is it kn@ckered! this is my first post so be gentle about the poor description.... cheers dave</content>
