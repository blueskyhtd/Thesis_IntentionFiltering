		<content>i purchased a panasonic 50st31 from comet 3 days ago but seem to be having a problem with the 3d detection. whilst watching some 3d content through my v+ box the tv started constantly jumping between 3d  2d for about 2 minutes, making it completely unwatchable. it seemed liked it was struggling to detect the 3d content. i rewound the programme to make sure it was not this particular part of the programme causing the problem but it didn't do it the second time. i had the 3d detection set to on  not advanced as earlier in the day whilst playing call of duty on split screen it was also switching from 2d to 3d, but i put this down to exactly the same images being displayed in both halves of the screen hence confusing the tv into thinking it was a 3d image. i think i will contact comet this morning to arrange an exchange on the tv.</content>
