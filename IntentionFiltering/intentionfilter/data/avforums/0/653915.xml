		<content>hi, will vlc potable on a external usb 1tb hardive work if connected to panasonic plasma? the reason is, that vlc portable is the only plugin that will open .rec media files/movies, on portable drives/disks etc. just wanted to know if this will work or will it have to be a powered hardrive for 1tb disk to work? its a real shame panasonics have no built in vlc so you can play any format.</content>
