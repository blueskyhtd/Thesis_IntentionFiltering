		<content>had this set since almost launch and up until recently (when i bought a sky hd box etc) the settings for each hdmi didn't bother me. however, i like to use the cinema setting and then tweak it to my own liking. but i can't seem to set each hdmi separately. if i choose hdmi 1 and setup the cinema setting, when i go to hdmi 2 or 3, those settings carry across and if i tweak them on one of the other inputs, then they carry back across to hdmi 1. surely there is a way of me setting each input individually? thanks.</content>
