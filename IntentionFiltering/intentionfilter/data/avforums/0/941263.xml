		<content>is there any difference in the technology between these tv's apart from the 3d? i'm not interested in 3d whatsoever but i'm wondering if the st30 is worth â£50 more than the s30 (amazon prices). comparing them side by side on the panasonic website they seem to be pretty much the same apart from the 3d aspect.</content>
