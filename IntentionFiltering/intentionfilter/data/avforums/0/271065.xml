		<content>hi all, i need more help, i was originally all set for the purchase of a g10, but these things are almost impossible to find at a good price in stock at the moment, after reading a review of both the g10 and the s10 on what hifi's website i am now in even more of a muddle, they suggest there is nearly no difference between the models, so, not so much for the â£30 price difference, mostly stock differences do i bite the bullet and go for the s10. at the end of the day i am interested in one thing, i currently have an old 28" phillips tube set, if i have a picture quality as good as or better, i will be a happy man, obviously if it is worse.........then well.......what a waste of a lot of money. cheers, rob.</content>
