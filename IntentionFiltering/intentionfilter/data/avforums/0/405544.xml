		<content>currently using a 37 inch pd60 thats 6 years old and has been used for 30k hours. i've never had a problem with it but i'm thinking of moving this to the bedroom or sell it. i can get a panasonic txp42vt20 for â£600 with five year warranty, is it a no brainer or should i give it a miss?</content>
