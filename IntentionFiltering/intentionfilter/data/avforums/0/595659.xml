		<content>my lg ps3000 got the red haze error, best described as being like when back in the day when you had to use a coathanger for an aerial and had a bad picture add to that a red/pink wash to the whole picture. plus there is a buzzing sound, almost like a fan but certainly louder than what is normal. anyway engineer reports states 'internal main circuit board (pcb), the sustain z/y pcbs have failed'. anyone know how much i can pick up replacements of this type and if i would be able to do the work myself. i know its a big ask, any advice would be appreciated.</content>
