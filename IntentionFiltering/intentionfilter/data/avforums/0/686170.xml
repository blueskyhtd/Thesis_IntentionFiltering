		<content>i don't post on here very often but i do read a lot, so i thought i'd contribute to the forum with a guide to how i installed my pioneer 436xde with 5 bw fpm speakers. i have never done anything like this before, not really the diy sort, but i thought i'd give it a go, so i took photos to show you where i went wrong! hope you find it helpful!! http://bix.cc/tvinstall (takes a while to load, lots of pictures) edit: the page has now been moved and now includes some finished pictures, enjoy! bix</content>
