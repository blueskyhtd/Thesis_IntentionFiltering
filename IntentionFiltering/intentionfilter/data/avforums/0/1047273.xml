		<content>got a new tx-p50vt30y yesterday and have discovered a nasty problem... seems it has problems with some 30fps games - for example 3rd person games where the player controls the in-game camera. tried uncharted 2 and infamous 2 on playstation 3 where there is a lot of ugly choppyness or juddering (not sure what to call it) which i did not have on my old sony bravia w3000 lcd. i have tried several picture modes (normal, thx, game) and tried to enable/disable several settings, without a major difference i tried another similar game in 60fps (ratchet  clank quest for booty) which was silky smooth and so is wipeout hd (another 60fps title). is this a known problem with a fix/solution, or am i stuck with the issue? thanks in advance!</content>
