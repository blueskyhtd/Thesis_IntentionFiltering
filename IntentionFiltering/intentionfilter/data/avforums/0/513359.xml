		<content>hi everyone, i'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but basically i need some help. i bought a lg 42pj650 tv off ebay about a month a go, it was going cheap because it had a small crack in the front glass panel. however the crack grew bigger and it turns out there were more as well that grew bigger. does anyone know of anywhere that i can find a replacement outer shell - including glass front, it doesnt matter about price really, and i am happy to fit it myself so i just need the case. any advice on this would be appreciated, thanks, james</content>
