		<content>hi all, today i installed my p50vt30, first experiences on image quality are very positive. although i have something strange, the image starts about 5cm from the left of the effective part of the screen. in the setup menu a part of the text is missing on the left side, i restorend to factory settings and went through all setup options but can't get it covered. from a user point of view it looks like the first 5cm (horizontal) of the screen are not used/ active. i tried all aspect ratio's but since the menu (from initial setup on) also shows the same problem, i think it's not the aspect ratio (in all ratio's the same around 5cm are black/ unused). here are some pictures: http://www.sierracosworth.nl/img/tx-p50vt30/ does someone recognise this problem? regards, cris (netherlands)</content>
