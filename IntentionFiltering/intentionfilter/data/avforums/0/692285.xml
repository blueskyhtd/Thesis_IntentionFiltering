		<content>hi, i bought a panasonic g10 plasma from marks and spencers with a 5 year guarantee. the faults are mll black level rises and image retention for still images left on for short periods of time like 30 seconds. i understand from reading the threads that the problem still happens after a engineer fix. so because of this i would like a refund or exchange. is it easier to get a refund/exhange through panasonic or the retailer? is there a template letter i can use in my email or post? whats the correct procedure to get this situation resolved? thanks,</content>
