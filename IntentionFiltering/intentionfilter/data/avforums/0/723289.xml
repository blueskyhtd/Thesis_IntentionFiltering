		<content>i only really found out about this because panasonic publish this information. does anyone else ? would be interesting to see what the values for this really are on new plasma/lcd sets. surely this is much more important than static. does anyone not watch a moving picture on their tv ? how do tv companies get away with this ? how many consumers are buying a full hd set with a low 'moving picture resolution'(mpr) or perhaps newer lcd/plasma have quite a high mpr and the consumer is ok. well who knows as its impossible to find any information on this</content>
