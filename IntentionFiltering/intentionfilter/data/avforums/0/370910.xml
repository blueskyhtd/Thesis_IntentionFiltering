		<content>hi, i live in germany and after weeks of umming and rrring about which tv to get i had decided on the tx-p50g30b. but, i couldn't find it on the panasonic.de site or in many other places for that matter. they do however have the tx-p50gw30 which seems quite similar. anyone know if this is similar/better/worse? many thanks</content>
