		<content>i'm considering getting one of these tvs. i note that the resolution is only 1024x768 though? i watch mainly sports and normal programmes. i sit around 3m away from the tv. i'm considering a 1080p 40" lcd tv as well that's the same price. i know little about tvs so any help would be appreciated! thanks</content>
