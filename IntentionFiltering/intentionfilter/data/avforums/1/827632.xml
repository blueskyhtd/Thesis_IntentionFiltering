		<content>the above package is retailing for around â£670+. does anyone know where i can buy it for under â£600? i know there is only â£70 in it but i started out my search looking for a blu ray only and have since moved up to a tv also and now onto complete packages. after much deliberation and researching i have found the 32" version for around â£480. my current sony bravia is 32" and i would like to upgrade to the 37" if possible but i don't want to break the bank either many thanks</content>
