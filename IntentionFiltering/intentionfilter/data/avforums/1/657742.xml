		<content>hi guys, i have made 1 or 2 threads asking about specific tv's but now i have started my search again. i was set on a panasonic st30 but after hearing about all the problems i have moved away from it. i want the set to last a while (2-3 years) so i would prefer it to be 3d and also 1080p. i want a plasma because they seem to be the best for gaming and i believe they produce the best pq available. i don't really want a panasonic because of all the problems (well, i could maybe buy a refurb gt20 or something like that) so the main brands i'm looking at are samsung and sony since they seem to have the best reputation (although i may be mistaken!) so, i have a budget of â£650 to work with and i mostly do gaming (about 90% gaming, 9% blu-ray, 1% freeviewhd!). one of the main things is that i want the tv to be able to reduce jaggies a bit. i know this is a problem with the consoles but i have heard some tv's are good at jaggies reduction and getting rid of them. thanks alot!</content>
