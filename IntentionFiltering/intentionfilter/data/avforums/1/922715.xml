		<content>hi all, i'm looking for some advice. i'm currently refurbing our back room and want to have a 37" tv wall mounted approx 5 ft high (bottom edge) to be viewed from a normal sitting down on a sofa height. its a lounge/diner arrangement which will be running a v+ box as its main input, as well as apple tv. 37" is as large as i want to go given the dimensions of the room. outside of the obvious picture quality, my main feature requirements are: 1) must be able to play all the normal pc movie files via ethernet dnla/upnp (mkv etc...) - planning to run files from a synology nas. 2) reasonable in built speakers are a must - this one wont be rigged up to surround sound as we have another setup in our main room. we already have a nice panny 42" plasma  sony surround system for the films i'm not fussed on 3d - if its a feature then great, but not expecting much at my budget level. i've been looking at the panasonic tx-l37e30b, but any advice greatly appreciated. finally i dont want to pay more than â£600 tops - that needs to include a decent warranty also. thanks in advance</content>
