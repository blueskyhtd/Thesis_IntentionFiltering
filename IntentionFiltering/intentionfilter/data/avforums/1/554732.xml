		<content>i have a p42g20b panasonic tv. i'm currently using sky, but will want to switch to the tv's own freesat when i cancel sky. unfortunately the centre speaker of my 5.1 system sits infront of the tv, making it impossible to control the tv. i was wondering if its possible to attach an external infrared module to the tv? couldnt seem to find anything on google. i'm looking at spending â£20-30 (no more, as i could put that towards a freesat box) thanks</content>
