		<content>hi i'm thinking of buying a 65 inch plasma and am looking at the panasonic txp65vt30b. reading about some 50hz issues and ?floating blacks has left me a little worried. does anybody have knowledge of this model or indeed perhaps suggest another 65 inch screen that maybe better? thanks</content>
