		<content>hi all, i'm looking to replace my ageing hitachi 42" plasma for a newer set, always said the next tv will be panasonic so in your opinion which set should i be looking at. i don't need freeview or 3d or endless connectivity.....just a basic plasma but obviously with as best as possible pic' quality for as cheap as possible the hitachi has been and still is a great plasma but falls down especially with blu-ray in darker scenes, whether this is because of contrast levels or what i don't know but i'm hoping a newer screen will help. there are endless panasonic models available from many places typically â£399-â£500+........any ideas on what to look for? is there much point looking at anything other than the tx-p42s30b @â£399???</content>
