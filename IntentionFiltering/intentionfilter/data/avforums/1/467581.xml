		<content>evening everyone. i'm on a mission to find myself a 3d tv. i've heard great things about the st and gt 30 models. now, on amazon the st30 is â£650 and the gt30 is â£850. what's the difference between the two models and is the gt30 worth â£200 more? ps my primary use for the tv will be gaming and watching blu-rays, both in 2d and 3d. pss could anyone post some pics if you own one of the tvs please? thanks in advance</content>
