		<content>hi, i have a question about two tv's, i was going to buy the panasonic tx-p42st30b, but i have seen the gt20b for â£110 cheaper, so my main concern is. is there enough of a difference between the two tv's to warrant an extra â£110 which i could use on 3d glasses. also i could not find information on which glasses are compatible with the gt20b, i was going to buy the ty-ew3d3me glasses. thanks.</content>
