		<content>does anyone have any recommendations? i was looking around at the samsung ps43d450a2w and its 3d counterpart for a while and it seemed to have something called "clear image panel" but from reviews/opinions it doesn't seem to cut reflections and such down. to make matters worse i went on the samsung us site for this same tv and it says it has filterbright technology but clearly the uk version does not. at the moment i have just recieved an lg 42pt353k and i simply cannot stand the reflections. can anyone help me with a finding a decent priced plasma with decent antio-reflective please? (and yes, i know, get decent curtains and light shade.)</content>
