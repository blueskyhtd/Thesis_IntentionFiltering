		<content>i have read a few reviews etc. with varying results... one says the d550 black levels are quite a bit worse then the 6900 and another 2 say they are quite close... it seems the image quality of these 2 is quite similar except the d6900 has a nicer bezel, less reflective coating, internet features and more calibration options.... i am not sure if this is worth the extra â£220 over the d550... i am not that bothered about internet as it is not that great anyway... i could live with the reflection but the main things that interest me are : better black levels, is the sd scaling any different? hmmm has anyone tried both of these and can tell me how close they are in terms of image quality?</content>
