		<content>hi, i am gonna buy a new tv and the viewing distance is about 5 m (= 17 feet). i am considering a 64" plasma, samsung ps64d8005. i have two questions. 1. is a 64" tv suitable for this distance? 2. the tv will be used a lot for playing wii. will the picture be totally unviewable with a tv at this size? the wii doesn't support hd. thanks! and a happy new year!</content>
