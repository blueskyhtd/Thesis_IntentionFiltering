		<content>i bought a vt30 this summer, but too many faults and bugs made me return it shortly after. i figured i should wait a year, for the 2012 models, but now i have heard that a retailer nearby has two new lx-5090 in stock, and i'm considering if i should buy one or not. the price is 1800 gbp. what do you think? is it getting too old now, and what price would you pay for one? thanks.</content>
