		<content>as it says really ... i have â£1500 spend to spend on a plasma, i would use it for dvd's, football and hd xbox360. i dont know to much about the technology, i read all this stuff about pixel burning and contrast etc, and as much as ive read pages after pages of specs, i would like the views of people who own and use their plasma's everyday to give me a real idea. thanks in advance to those who help regards phil</content>
