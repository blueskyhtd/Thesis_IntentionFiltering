		<content>hey all i'm on the look out for a new 50" panasonic plasma tv (as i'm always blown away by the quality of images on the the screens). about a year ago i had a 50" panasonic plasma tx-p50g20bbut the buzz (when there were bright white images on the screen) was just unbearable, so it had to go back to amazon. i was wondering whats around today that might suit me that doesnt have this awful problem? thanks</content>
