		<content>is there a difinitive answer ( i couldnt find one!), has the 8000 got better pq than the 6900? i'm looking to buy in the next week or so. i havent ruled out a gt30 for some strange reason, i think this is more because i'm thinking if/ when it goes wrong i'll ask for a 2012 replacement. any replies will be welcome. i hate buying tvs. i bought my last one 7 yrs ago, an lg 37lc2d!!</content>
