		<content>basically since i had this set last year i've had a few niggles with it. i've tried living with them but have now decided i want a set that does everything i want it to, unlike this one sadly. john lewis will replace the set for an equivalent model (about â£2k) and i do like panasonic, as i had a 42" plasma before this one that was superb. what's the best put there now?</content>
