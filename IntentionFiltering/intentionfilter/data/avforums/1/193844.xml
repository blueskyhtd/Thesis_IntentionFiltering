		<content>hi all has anyone had any experiences with the two tv sets mentioned above? 3d performance is not really a big issue. i had the 50" panny v20 before this, which i have now sold. i would like to buy something smaller and have narrowed it down to these two - effectively the best plasma set and led set available at the moment. your opinions would be very much appreciated. thanks in advance!</content>
