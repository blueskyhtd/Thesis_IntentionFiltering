		<content>hi, i am trying to decide if the extra 8'' are worth or not the â£450 price difference. are there any differences between the two in terms of picture quality besides the size? i have seen the 59'' model which was just stunning, is the 51'' basically the same but in a smaller package? thanks in advance</content>
