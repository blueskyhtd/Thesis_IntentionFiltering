		<content>richer sounds are selling the vt20 at â£800.the gt30 can be found for â£850 so nothing in it. which is the best option for 2d tv and dvd. i have a projector in a different room for br. so mostly for terretrial and dvd's when i want to watch an old films and not be reminded of low resolution on a 134" screen. this will be stand alone in terms of sound. any thoughts on the extra â£500 on the vt30</content>
