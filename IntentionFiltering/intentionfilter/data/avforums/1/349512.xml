		<content>hi there, i'm looking to buy a 50 inch or above plasma tv around the â£1000 mark, but idealy i'd rather pay â£700 - â£800 depending on what you can get. i'd be using it for a lot of gaming, blu ray films etc. 3d would also be nice. so i was just wondering what tv would be best to buy in the uk? thanks</content>
