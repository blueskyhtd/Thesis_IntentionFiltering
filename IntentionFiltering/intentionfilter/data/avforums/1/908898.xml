		<content>are all modern plasma's capable of displaying both ntsc and pal video on the actual screen? (apart from the in-built tuner for live tv which is obviously pal only). because i have lots american av equipment, dvd's and games consoles and i'm buying a uk tv, will they work? old pal tv's used to go grey when fed with ntsc video. thanks</content>
