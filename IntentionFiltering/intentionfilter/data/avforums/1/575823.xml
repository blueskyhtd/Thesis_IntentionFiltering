		<content>for the last couple if weeks i have been looking for a replacement for my samsung 42in plasma. afetr reading review after review i narrowed it down to the 42g30 or the 42gt30. although i am not bothered with the 3d, the gt has the black pro filter. then i came across the 50hz bug thread and now i am in a quandry. has anyone got any advice about this or an alternative to the pannys? thanks</content>
