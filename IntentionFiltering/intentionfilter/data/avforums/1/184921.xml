		<content>next week i want to buy a new 42 inch tv. i already decided that i will buy a tv with a plasma display, but i can't choose between 3 different models, mainly because i don't really know the difference between hd-ready and fullhd. i want to use the tv for three things: watching non-hd tv channels, connecting the xbox to my tv, and connecting my pc to the tv. my main concern is, that two of the tvs which i want to buy are hd-ready, and at each site i checked, it says that their native resolution is 1024x768. but my pc runs at a resolution of 1280x1024, and i would like to share my display with the tv, but to do this, i need my tv to run at the same resolution. so my first question is, that if i connect the pc with my tv using a hdmi cable, can i set it to a resolution bigger than it's native resolution, or the max resolution for the tv display is it's native resolution?(this would be helpful as the hd-ready tv's which i want, are 60â£ cheaper at my country then the fullhd tv, and price is an issue to me:p) secondly, i would be grateful if someone could point me to some reviews about my tv's, as i can't really find anything about them on the net except the specifications, and some lame reviews from which i don't understand nothing at all(perhaps the problem is with me:p)). comparissions would be even better. these are the tv's which i would consider buying(with their prices, converted from ron to gbp): samsung 3d ps43d490 ~380â£ lg 3d 42pw450 ~ 385â£ panasonic neopdp 3d tx-p42st30e ~ 445â£ sorry, but i can't post url for the specs, i'm a new member</content>
