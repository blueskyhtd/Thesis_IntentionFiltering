		<content>hi, i am very close to buying a samsung ps51d6900 plasma.... i think that is upscales 50hz to 100hz? such as pal tv etc? so if i set an xbox or ps3 or pc output to 50hz will the tv automatically switch to 100hz thus eliminating flicker? please get back to me if you know asap thanks!</content>
