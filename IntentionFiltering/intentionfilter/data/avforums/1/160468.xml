		<content>i understand the panasonic line up runs like so: vt30 - ultra high end gt30 st30 g30 u30? - bottom end c3b - last years model in new chassis do the g3/st/gt/vt use the same panel? also looking back through the generations, was this the same line up style for 20 and 10? would a high end 20 beat a low end 30? i am looking to buy a panny plasma from bestbuy sale and want to make sure i know what i am getting. thanks!</content>
