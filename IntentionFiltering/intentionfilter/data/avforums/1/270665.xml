		<content>evening chaps it's been a bloody good while since i posted on here. i think! some time ago i had a beautiful, flawless pioneer 5090 that took an age to arrive. utterly stunning. anyway after a couple of weeks of owning it i fell over, smashed it and took an intense hatred to plasmas from thereon in. -) i replaced it with an equally beautiful, actually, more beautiful, samsung led whilst knowing full well it wasn't/isn't in the same league as the pioneer. i went for it simply because it was so thin and utterly sexy. my enthusiasm died the day i wrecked my pioneer so decided to go mainstream anyway, my samsung (that i do love) is a couple of years old and sometime this year (circa june-july) i'd like to put the samsung in the bedroom and get a new chap for the living room. this isn't a "what tv should i buy?" thread as such because i have no intention of buying one just yet. i am, however, very curious to hear what the state of the plasma tv market is like at the moment. are plasmas still favoured as feverishly over led/lcd as they were a couple of years ago with regards to picture quality? are plasma tvs still considered a good option or have led tvs caught up? one, in fact, the only considerable irritant i have with my samsung is the rather high input lag. the tv i have now is a b8000. with that being my only major annoyance, you may well infer that i am happy with the overall picture and quality of the tv. i am. i would never spend â£2300 on a tv again. in fact, i don't think i'd spend upwards of â£1200 anymore. are panasonic plasmas still the best in the absence of pioneer? with it being so early in 2012, this may be difficult to predict, but are there any plasmas on the horizon that i should take notice of that are due to launch in april-june time? cheers chaps. it's very nice to back. i have to post under a new name these days as i used my real name before and didn't like the idea of my students finding me! thanks! pixelated.</content>
