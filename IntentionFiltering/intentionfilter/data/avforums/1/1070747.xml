		<content>we have a 42" panasonic pe50, about 6yrs old, we want to get a 50" with hd. we watch with a v+ box, but so far not able to watch any hd as tv is too old. i am looking at either the panasonic tx-p50c3b which is hd ready or the tx-50u30b which is full hd. we need to be able to connect the v+ bos and our old dvd recorder which is the panasonic dmr-es20. we have been very pleased with the tv we have, would just like a bit bigger now. any suggestions very welcome. many thanks</content>
