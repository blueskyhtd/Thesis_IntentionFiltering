		<content>are panasonic expected to release any 2d 46" plasmas in the uk this year? i have zero (nay negative) interest in 3d so certainly don't want to pay extra for something i shall never use! i can only see a 46gt30 upgrading from a 37", don't think 42" will be enough and 50" will be too much - only around 7-8ft away (tv - sd/sky hd, dvd, blu-ray, no gaming) otherwise i may be forced to consider a samsung lcd-led reckon i'll have a grand (with 5 year warranty) - plan to wait until next spring (get in time for the olympics as don't think i have got any tickets ) i did toy with the idea of a 46g20 from rs, but think they have pretty much all gone now cheers chaps</content>
