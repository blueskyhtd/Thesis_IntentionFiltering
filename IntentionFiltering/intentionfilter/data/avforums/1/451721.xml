		<content>hi, two kids finally wore me down and i relented to getting a replacement for 10 year old crt tv. based on internet reviews i bought a panasonic 42" st30 which should be delivered in a couple of days. now i need advice as to what cabling i need, kids have wii which has 3 coloured wires, youngest has just got a ps3. we've a sky box which will now probably be replaced with a sky digital. we're wifi connected so will probably buy one of those dongle things. don't have a blue ray player but ps3 plays blue rays. so what all cabling do i need to order and what sort of price should i be paying for it, is cabling at â£50 a go worth it. have to get the cabling in advance of tv. any help appreciated.</content>
