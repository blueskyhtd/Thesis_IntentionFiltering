		<content>hi, i posted yesterday in the 'what tv' forum to get some advice to start me off, now i think i've decided on a plasma i'm looking for more specific advice. i think i've narrowed it down to these two, there is â£100 between them at richer sounds (the lg being cheaper). i'm not keen on the look of the panasonic on the photos i've seen on the web but i think i saw one in store at the weekend, assuming it was the correct model, and it looked ok. the lg doesn't particularly look great either but at least a bit more modern. obviously, the main priority is picture quality. i watch mostly football and a bit of xbox gaming, and other than that just normal evening tv. the football is the main priority, i want that crisp, textured grass you get on football on the top end tv's, but hopefully without paying top money. i don't really want to go higher than the â£599 for the panasonic, unless there is something considerably better for a little more. any opinions welcome!</content>
