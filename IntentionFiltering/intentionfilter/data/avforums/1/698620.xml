		<content>been looking on the web, ebay etc and can't seem to find any second hand ones for sale at much below price of a new tv maybe just a lack of availibility. so would anyone have an approx idea of how much they'd think is an ok price to pay for a second hand tx-p42g10b as far as i know the one i can have if i want it is in good/very good condition  is around 12-18 months old.</content>
