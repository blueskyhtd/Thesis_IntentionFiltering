		<content>i'd really like to upgrade to a 65inch screen. there doesn't seem to be a single tv out there that doesn't have major issues. i don't mean that no tv has perfect attributes ie contrast etc but issues like fluctuating brightness or peeling screens! why can nobody make a 65 inch screen that doesn't have a major flaw??</content>
