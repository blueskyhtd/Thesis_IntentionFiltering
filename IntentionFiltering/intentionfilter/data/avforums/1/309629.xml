		<content>hi everyone, i'm in the market to buy a new tv. i currently own a samsung 32'' led monitor and decided it's time to buy something bigger. i have a sky hd full sub, watch mainly sports, movies and xbox, i also have many avi and mkv files (mainly boxing) that i like to watch. i want to stick with samsung, as past experiences have been good, plus the design look sleak. so, i have finally narrowed it down to two - ue46d5520 vs ue46d5000, both 46'' led screens and only slight differences as far as i can see. i have two questions for anyone out there - i'm after a tv that can play mkv's, avi's but needs to be able to stream live football from the internet, eg 3pm ko's direct through the tv - i understand the d5000 can't do this, does this mean i would need a tv with the smart tv function ? and finally, in people's honest opinions, which tv is better, why, plus, am i completely wrong with what i'm looking at and should be looking at a different model ? thanks in advance.</content>
