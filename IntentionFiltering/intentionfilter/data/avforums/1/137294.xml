		<content>i used to own a pk350, great tv but i recently had to sell it unfortunately. i thought it was tremendous value for money, i'm now looking for a new 50in plasma (on a very tight budget sadly) so i figured i'll look at lg first. so i'm wondering what is it's replacement? or what current lg plasma would be closest to it in terms of spec? thanks..</content>
