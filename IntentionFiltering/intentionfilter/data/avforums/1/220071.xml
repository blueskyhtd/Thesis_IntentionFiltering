		<content>there's a few going here in ireland, brand new, for e999. now i'm aware of the 50hz thing (having once owned a 50v20), but i still feel it's a great tv for the price. i'm wondering though, if i were to wait a few months, would i be able to buy a tv from this years range (not just panasonic, any make) that may be better? at around the same price? any views on this? thanks...</content>
