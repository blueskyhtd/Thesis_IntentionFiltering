		<content>http://www.johnlewis.com/231222456/product.aspx i've been looking at buying this for a while and i'm just after some opinions if anyone has bought it and could tell me what they think of it and if they are happy with their purchase. i was also a bit concerned with "burn in" could anyone help to convince me that i won't just ruin my tv with burn in? is it hard to do and / easy to avoid? thank you very much for any help you are able to give me either on burn in or the actual tv itself. james</content>
