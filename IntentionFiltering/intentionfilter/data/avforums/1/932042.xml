		<content>i'm pretty much decided on getting a 42" vt30, and i settled on 42" because it was the biggest my wife would agree to. however... looking at a paper cut out of a 42" screen, i'm not sure it actually gives me a larger perceived viewing area / viewing angle - maybe a few degrees. take a look at the pic and see if you think it's worth having? photos is from the seating position, which is 11.5 feet from the wall.</content>
