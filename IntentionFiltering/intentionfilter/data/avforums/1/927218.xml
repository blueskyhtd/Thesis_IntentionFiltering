		<content>i'm in the market for a new tv and have more or less decided on a panasonic 42" plasma. not being very flush with cash, i'm looking at low end models and will probably go for a u30 or s30. but now i see an s31 model appearing. does anyone know the difference between the s30 and s31?</content>
