		<content>narrowed down my search to either the panasonic tx-p42gt30b or panasonic tx-p42st30b. i was in curry's today and they all waffle on about this price match in their adverts. yet when i posed the question about john lewis and richer sounds offering better warranty packages the saleman said they were limited warranty's they offered. is this true for even a the 5 year warranty's they now offer? was this basically bs? also my other question is that basically i am wondering if the panasonic tx-p42gt30b is worth the extra money over the tx-p42st30b? any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance!</content>
