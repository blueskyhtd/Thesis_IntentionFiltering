		<content>hi guys, having had great exeprience with my 37" panasonic plasma, i'm very tempted to go panasonic again, with the 50" 1080p model. i can get this for around â£550, which seems an awesome deal. however, i'm also intrigued by the equivalent lg model, which is available around â£465, again, a ridiculous deal it seems. question is, how do the two brands generally compare? for the sake of an extra â£85 odd for the panasonic it seems daft not to. what do you think?</content>
