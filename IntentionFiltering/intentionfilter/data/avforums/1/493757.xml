		<content>finally decided to replace my old panasonic 37" px70 and have narrowed it down to the g30  gt30. i don't really need 3d currently as it really doesn't float my boat so the g30 would probably more than suffice, though i do prefer the styling and better build quality of the gt30 and i like the fact it has a filter to help bright light (my tv is right next to a window). my main concern is that i see there seem to be many problems regarding the green tinge effect though , but they do seem to be more common on the gt30 (correct me if i'm wrong on this). i suppose my question is more along the lines of which one is less likely to have the green tinge fault, or is it really a lottery on either. many thanks</content>
