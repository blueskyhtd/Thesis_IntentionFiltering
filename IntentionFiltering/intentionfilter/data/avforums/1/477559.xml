		<content>hi all, ive been looking for a tv to use as a pc monitor to play high end games suc as fps. the problem ive been having is that lcd's have high input lag and/or lots of motion blur so i wouldnt be able to enjoy sports either. this has lead me to a plasma but i have heard of problems with image retention, so has anyone got any experience of this? i came up with the g30 as im not bothered about 3d or tv internet features, and my budget is around â£600 and i was looking for at least 40" any info appreciated, cheers, luke</content>
