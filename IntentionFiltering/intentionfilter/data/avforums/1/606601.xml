		<content>hi, i've had a th42pz85b and a th46pz85b for a few years now and i'm looking for another 42" tv, i'm really impressed with the picture quality of both sets mainly used for watching sky/hd (football with ifs off!) and blu ray. can someone help me out by telling me the latest models which are as good picture quality wise - perhaps they all are. i haven't read the details but there seems to be some concern of the neo pdp screens...are they really that bad? perhaps i should pick up a second hand pz80/pz85/pz800?? i certainly think the the styling on the older models is better than the bland new versions. thoughts welcome. n16e</content>
