		<content>i'm trying to figure out which tv to buy. i think i've settled on a plasma 50" (or there about), and i will mostly use the tv for movies, tv and some gaming. i haven't quite decided on going for 3d or 2d. so one question first concerning that. is it possible to download a 3d movie and play it (through network) in 3d on the tv? can the tv convert "regular" tv into 3d? or do i have to have specific 3d-blu-rays to enjoy 3d at all? in any case, i've read that the p50g30 from panasonic are really good tvs, although they do not have 3d. but i also see that the lg 50pz550 is offered at a low price so i consider going for that instead, as it includes 3d, but i really want the picture quality to be the first and foremost priority. i can now get the panasonic for about â£1050 and the lg for about â£750 (i'm norwegian, so the prices are probably a bit different here that what you're used to). i would have gone for either of the 3d panasonic models, but they're a tad outside my budget, unfortunately. any advice on which to go for (or other suggestions/comments for that matter)?</content>
