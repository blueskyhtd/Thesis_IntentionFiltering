		<content>am thinking of buying a panansonic vt30 plasma but then started looking at the now cheaper superceded vt20. can anyone tell me the significant differences between the 2 models, if there is nothing too significant am thinking of saving a few pounds on the vt20. i would like the netflix capability. also can anyone tell me if both these models use the 'one piece of glass' look like the old v10, a friend has this model and i like that look. thanks</content>
