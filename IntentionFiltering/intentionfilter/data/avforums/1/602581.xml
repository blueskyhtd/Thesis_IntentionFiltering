		<content>i am in the market for a 46" - 50" tv for occasional gaming and movies. i am on a shoestring budget of â£200 - â£300 so am limited on my selection, however, i am doing everything i can not to compromise on the picture quality. 1080p is important, as is the ability to reproduce shadow details well. i have the option to buy a ps50q96hd for â£250, it doesn't fit my criteria well, but i seem to have run out of options. is this tv worth that amount of money? are there any other options which i have overlooked? many thanks.</content>
