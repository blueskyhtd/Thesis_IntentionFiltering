		<content>as an aside to a thread i started about a fault with this set of mine i have been doing some googling as to what the fault might be. as there is a possibility it could be the panel that has gone, is the g series the nearest equivalent, bearing in mind this tv was one of the better tv's in their range when i bought it? i'll be dealing with john lewis under their 5 year warranty and will be hoping it can be fixed as i love this tv so much. but if it is worse case scenario should i be looking at a g model? the cheap model they do sounds awful compared to the quality i have been enjoying with this set. i can't see 3d because of an eyesight problem, so have no interest in any of those models at all. thanks for any input.</content>
