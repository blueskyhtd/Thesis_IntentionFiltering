		<content>i currently have toshiba wlt68 toshiba regza 37wlt68 review | tvs | cnet uk and have been very happy with it until now because it has 3 horizontal lines across the screen, getting darker all the time, so i need to replace. my space is limited so i can only fit a 37" or 40" if it is led (width 95cm). i am also on a budget of around â£500. lastly my eyes are very sensitive to flickering , i.e. i notice it, which is why i bought the toshiba with 100hz any and all suggestions greatly appreciated thanks steve</content>
