		<content>probably not the place to post this but i'll give it a go im going to order a panny tx-p42u30b for amazon for â£434.90. great price, but it says it wont be dispatched for two months! is this true? or is it shipped out earlier than this? i can spend an extra â£50 and i'll have it by the end of the week if i buy from another shop that amazon is also advertising but... â£434 is already alot</content>
