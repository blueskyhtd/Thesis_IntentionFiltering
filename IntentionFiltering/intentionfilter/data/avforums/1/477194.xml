		<content>hi there, looking for a bit of confirmation really... i have struck a deal with my local panasonic store for â£980 to include the tx-p42gt30 the dmp-bd110 bd player(worth between â£150-â£180 after searches) and 4 3d blurays including avatar (which i understand is worth about â£60-â£80 on it's own) good deal????? considering the tx-p42g30 is now only â£686.90 on amazon?</content>
