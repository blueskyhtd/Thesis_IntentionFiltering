		<content>hi, i am looking to buy a plasma tv from panasonic's 2011 range. my viewing distance is about 13ft or 4m. i have a budget of max â£1500 and i am mostly looking to watch hd content on it. can't really decide between g30, st30, gt30 or vt30 (vt quite expensive for my budget anyway). i'm not a big fan of 3d, i'm more interesed in getting a great picture quality from bd player (or media box) and skyhd sources. i'm a bit concerned about the silver trim of the gt30 series, i saw it at different stores, in daylight it seems distracting. please advise. thank you. cornel</content>
