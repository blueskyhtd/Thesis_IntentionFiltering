		<title>replacing a small plasma (lg 32pg6000)</title>

		<content>i'm thinking of replacing my lg 32pg6000 because my son scratched the screen with his toys! i would love to stick with a plasma as i think it has the most natural picture. trouble is, i can't really go much bigger than 32" and there just aren't any plasmas that small. ideally i would like freeviewhd built-in and 1080p (for my ps3) but i can't find any plasmas smaller than 42" with these features. perhaps i have missed some? i think the room is too small for 42" so my looming predicament is having to consider an lcd. are current lcds still inferior in terms of natural-looking picture quality and viewing angles? if i did switch to lcd, will i regret it big-time?</content>
