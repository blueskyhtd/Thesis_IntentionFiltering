		<content>guys sorry if this is an old chesnut, i'm not a regular vistor. my problem is this - i have owned a pio pdp436xde since 2005, and been very happy with it. while standard def (sky) is a bit pants to be honest, i have seen nothing yet to touch it on hd , and yes it is only 720p ! having said that, i haven't made a point of actively looking for a screen recently, the only true comparison is my brother in laws 1080p panny (dont know the model ) , which to be honest aint as good on hd as my pio. i am looking to go up to a 50" inch screen though, so can anyone give me an objective opinion on whether (from an hd pic angle) a used kuro or a new vt 30 would be a better buy ? it's very difficult to find a shop that can give a decent demo of the panny, most of em have some silly 3d demo going on, and 3d ain't important to me.</content>
