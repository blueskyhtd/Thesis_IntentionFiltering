		<content>i'm moving house next week and my trusty old panasonic phd8 is getting a new home in the loft. i bought the plasma about 6 years ago and at the time lcd's were not even close to matching the picture quality of it. is this still true today with lcd/led sets? if i stick with plasma, which i almost certainly will, what's a good choice now? looking for a good 50" set that doesn't cost the earth!!</content>
