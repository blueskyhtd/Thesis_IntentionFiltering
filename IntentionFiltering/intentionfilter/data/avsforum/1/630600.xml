		<content>i got a rca d56w20 56 in. tv and it supports 1080i, i connect the htpc to the screen and the tv acts like it is the wrong res. i can view the pc but the screen bleeds over past the edge of the screen, i cannot however scroll to those points on the edge like on a pc monitor with the wrong res. i have tried intel, nivida, and ati cards all with the same result. i do not have the remote for this tv to reset it to defaults.. any help would be appreciated. i am connecting the pc through the dvi port (which works with my xbox 360 hdmi > dvi cable and looks great) i have not yet tried through the component cable since i will have to buy the dongle to send component out of my video card. any thoughts on this?</content>
