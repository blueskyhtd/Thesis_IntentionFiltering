		<content>i am in the first group of the rs20 pre order and i just wanted to get some idea on what screen other rs20 owners are planning to using with this projector. i would like to know the size, gain, aspect ratio and brand/model. as for me, i am leaning towards a motorized stewart st130 100 to 110", gain 1.3, 16:9. thanks, rich</content>
