		<content>instead of searching through 1000s of threads i decided to post my own. i just installed my panny ae3000 and i was going to install a 120 sarria screen thats motorized... but after testing the panny against the wall, i decided i need something between 125 to 130inch. so what manufacturers do you guys recommend and how much should a screen of that size cost me? im still kind of new to this whole projector scene. but i want the best bang for my buck, thanks!!!!</content>
