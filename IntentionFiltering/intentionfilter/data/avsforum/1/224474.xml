		<content>i heard the kuro's are pretty much impervious to burn in, but does this older model do 24p / ect. or am i better off with the new samsung 52" a650. i do a lot of gaming, and have had burn in issues, my local bb has the kuro heavily discounted nib. so idk, i need to make a descision soon.</content>
