		<content>i'm looking to get your opinions on which tv to get, the samsung pn50a450 or the panasonic 46pz85. the samsung is and the panasonic is. right now i don't have a blue ray player to take advantage of the 1080p, but may get one down the road. screen size they would both be plenty big enough for me. i guess i'm a little stuck on this decsion and could use some swaying to one or the other. thanks.</content>
