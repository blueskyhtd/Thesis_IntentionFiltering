		<content>i currently have a standard definition denon 3930ci dvd player hooked to my kds-r50xbr150" grand wega? sxrd television. i was considering buying a blu-ray player, however my television will only do 1080i. will i get any benefit if i upgrade from my standard definition (but highly rated) dvd player? optically, can someone see the difference between a blu-ray hooked to a 1080p television verses a 1080i televison?</content>
