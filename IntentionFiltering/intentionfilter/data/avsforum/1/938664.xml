		<content>hey everyone, i am trying to decide on a replacement for my samsung 24" lcd (pc monitor). i am looking for a 32" to wall mount and i am wondering which is my best option. my primary use will be desktop use (internet browsing  desktop applications), followed by gaming, and occassionally watching bluray movies (via cheap internal sony sata player). my viewing distance is about 3-4 feet. i have narrowed my search down to these 3 choices: 1) samsung ln-32a550 @ $900 2) samsung ln-32a650 @ $1000 3) sony kdl-32xbr6 @ $1000 ps: i don't want all the comparison of 120hz vs 60hz, just which would you choose given what i am using it for and price breakdown.</content>
