		<content>i'm looking at on-wall ht speaker options (space constrained). i've got a short-list down to the totem tribe i (l/r)  3 (c); or the morel vario on-wall. i also looked at the bg radia 17i/18i, although i heard the morel vario were better. i'm located in colorado, and having a hard time finding demo locations, although will be out in la in a few weeks so hoping to demo some then. any recommendations or suggestions between these options, or others that i might have missed?</content>
