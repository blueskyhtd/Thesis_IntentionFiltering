		<content>hi, i did a search online but i am still a little confused. my zip code is 92840 and antennaweb.org said that i was roughly 30 miles from the stations. i purchased a channel master 4228 but i having a rough time trying to figure out how to mount the thing. so i am thinking about getting a channel master 4220m or a antennasdirect db4 because it has a j-mount. do you think if the 4220m or the db4 will be good enough? thanks</content>
