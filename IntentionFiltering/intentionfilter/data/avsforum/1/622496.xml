		<content>i need to buy blu ray playback software. i don't want any solutions that i need to hack to work. so i've narrowed it down to either powerdvd 8 or arcsoft's totalmedia theatre. i plan to stream blu ray iso's from my media server to my htpc, so iso playback is a must. which one would you guys choose and why? thanks in advance.</content>
