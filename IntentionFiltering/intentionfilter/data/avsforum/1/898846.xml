		<content>is the pq of the toshiba pretty much on par with samsung? black levels, colors, sharpness, motion blur. the a550 is a lot cheaper but i'm willing to pay the premium if the toshiba has the same picture quality with 5:5 120hz. anyone actually have experience with both? or should i wait for the sony z series? thanks</content>
