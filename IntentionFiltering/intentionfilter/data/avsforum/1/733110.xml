		<content>hello, i'm having trouble deciding on a tv to get. it's my first time purchasing an hdtv, and i'm a little lost as to what is best. i want something 40 inches or more, but i can't really break 1k$. i am able to get both of these tvs for about the same price, which would be the better buy? people tell me sony's are the best, but when i read around online i see that samsung is a good brand as well. since it's my first time i don't want to make a mistake, especially with so much money..</content>
