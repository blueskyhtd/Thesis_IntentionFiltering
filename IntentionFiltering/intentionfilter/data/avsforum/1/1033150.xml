		<content>hi, just a couple of quick ones. i've decided on either the samsung 650 or 750 lcd 52" tv. it doesn't really matter which one. i found a couple places to order: http://www.paylessplasma.com/product...?productid=339 and http://www.drplasma.com/productdetai...productid=3309 anybody order from either of these places before? or is there another online standby i should order from? second thing...i know there is a stand for the 52" 650 and a different one for the 52" 750. for the life of me, i can't figure out what stand i need, and where i can order it? any help is greatly appreciated...thanks! dan</content>
