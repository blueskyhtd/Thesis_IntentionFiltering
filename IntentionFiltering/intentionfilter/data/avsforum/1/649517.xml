		<content>for those that have seen both sets, what does each set have over the other? my main question, is the panny ~$150 better than the sammy is? does one produce better whites and blacks? i am looking at about 50/50 hd and sd viewing. no bashing, i have limited expierence with plasmas, just want some comparison info.</content>
