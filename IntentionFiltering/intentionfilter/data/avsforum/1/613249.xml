		<content>hello, i'm not sure where to look but i just need to find out how big of a screen i need to fit in my gameroom which is 15x15. i want to be able to go the max as far as size of the screen. i don't have a projector at this time but soon i will plan on looking for a 1080p projector to mount on the cieling. the only thing i have is seating which is about 10-12 feet away from the wall i want to mount the screen on. is there a thread out there or formulas that i need to use to see what size of screen i need? thanks greg</content>
