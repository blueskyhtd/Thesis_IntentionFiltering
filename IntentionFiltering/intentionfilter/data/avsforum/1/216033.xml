		<content>i'm getting ready to take a jump into the home theater market and put together a system soon. i'm trying to get some research done and have narrowed it down to the onkyo 605 and sony 910. i like the 910 because it has 3 hdmi and i know the 605 has gotten rave reviews on here but i noticed some people have mentioned the popping. i was wondering if i could get any further feedback on either one. other quick home theater questions: what is a better bet for speakers, getting a "box set" or buying individual center/book shelf/etc? will these receivers take a 5.1 and change it to 7.1? what is the deal on the onkyo 576? has anyone had the chance to use one or heard any preliminary things? i should probably mention i'm on a budget of sorts. thanks for any help!</content>
