		<content>well looks like i will need to buy a region 2 dvd player to view some pal dvds, thing is i heard that current dvd players can be legally hacked to view region 2 dvds, is that true? i have a ps2, ps3, xbox  a xbox 360, any chance any of them can be easily modified to play pal dvds? i been looking around  the cheapest region free players are going for around $100  only upconvert to 1080i (i'm looking specifically for 1080p support).</content>
