		<content>i purchased a vizio xzt lcd to and am not happy with the jerky motion i get in movies and some tv shows. i use cable not will not go to hd. i have tried all settings and called tech support to no avail. i am considering sharp aquos lc5264u or samsung 52 in (unsure model). does any one have a idea which would produce a smother image? i understand these are larger sets and may introduce more problems. any input greatly appreciated.</content>
