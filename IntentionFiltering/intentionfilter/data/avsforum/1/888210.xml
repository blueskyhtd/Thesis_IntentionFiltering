		<content>i'm trying to decide between two rather equal models between the two best lcd brands, since i hardly find any difference in quality. what are the pros and cons between both the sammy ln-t4671f or sony 46w3000? those are both equally spec'd and priced by every sense of the word, and i don't know which direction would be better.</content>
