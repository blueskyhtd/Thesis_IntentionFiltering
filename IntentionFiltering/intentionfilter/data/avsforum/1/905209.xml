		<content>i am looking for a 40"-46" display. i currently have an offer on a panasonc 46" pz850u, but it's just a little more expensive than i'd like, and its dimensions are just a little larger than i'd want. so, i've decided to look into an lcd alternative, and am looking at the samsung a650/a750 series and the sony xbr6 series. general preference opinions would be nice, but in particular, i'd like to know: (1) what exactly is this clouding i've heard about, particularly on the xbr series? is it a feature, or a bug? (2) possible bugs aside, has there ever been an objective comparison made between the two?</content>
