		<content>hi all, i'm looking at getting a camcorder soon. i am debating between the sony sr10/11/12 and the canon hf11. i was wondering what the difference in picture quality is at the higher bit rate on the hf11. the only reason i am considering the hf11 is because it's the only camera out with the 24mbps ability (however i do prefer the large storage space on the sr10/11/12). thanks for any information, -ifandbut</content>
