		<content>based on what i've read about them, i'm thinking about getting a 50" panasonic plasma tv. the question is, which one? i've tried reading up on the various differences between them and what i've found is: pz80: base model pz85: - has a vga port - has some auto contrast dealie which is why it's rated as 30k:1 as opposed to 20k:1 for the pz80 pz800: - better audio - support for 24p (as opposed to other two models which use 3:2 pulldown) - extra hdmi input (4 instead of 3) - thx certified based on what i've read, the extra features don't appeal to me. supposedly, the 24p mode causes flicker, i don't care about extra inputs, and i've got a separate audio system. so is there any reason to buy either of the more expensive models?</content>
