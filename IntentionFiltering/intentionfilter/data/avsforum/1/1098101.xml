		<content>what january 2009 bd titles are you planning on purchasing? i bought more than i planned in november and december so i'm really cutting back in january, plus there aren't that many titles that appeal to me. buy on release: the pink panther (original 1964 peter sellers release) buy at a later date: the last emperor rental: french connection zodiac</content>
