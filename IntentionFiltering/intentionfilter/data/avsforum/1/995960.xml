		<content>three years ago, i purchased some klipsch promedia 2.0 speakers after seeking advice from audiophiles like yourselves for the best 2.0 system under $150. and i loved them. i mean i really loved them! unfortunately for my ears and for my budget, i am running into the problem that apparently everyone else but me knew about with these speakers, and the left speaker is now on the fritz. i am looking to replace them with another 2.0 system. it's three years later, but i'm turning to you, the pros, again: (nowadays) what's the best 2.0 speaker system in the 150-dollar ballpark?</content>
