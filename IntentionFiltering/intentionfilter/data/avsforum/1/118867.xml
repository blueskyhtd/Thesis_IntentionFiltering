		<content>we are going to make a gaming room so does anyone have any good recommendations? i would prefer to choose from tvs from bestbuy because they have alot of coupons usually... but if i can find a better deal somewhere else please let me know! i was looking at the pioneer plasmas... expensive but are there any good deals on them? we wouldn't want to spend over 2k i don't think. so any recommendations please keep them coming! thanks!</content>
