		<content>hi there, so i just stumbled across a home theater store the other day and after a quick look round, i started to play with the idea of getting a projector again, maybe a mitsu hc1500 or the opto hd70. my problem is where i can put my screen.. i currently have a mitsu 46" lcd which sits on an ikea av bench. i have nht c4s either side of the bench and am due to have a c3c speaker in the next few weeks. so obviously the screen has to go in front of the tv so what are my options? should i get a portable? or maybe a fixed screen with some kind of stand to so that i can put it onto the av bench whenever i want to watch a movie. i have high a high slanted ceiling (plus i'm in rented accomotation) so ceiling mounting really isn't an option. here are a couple of pics: (oh, and yes i know it's a mess. i'm just waiting for my emotiva lmc-1 to arrive to go back into that bottom left slot. i sold my nad t753 last week and just waiting for the replacement! )</content>
