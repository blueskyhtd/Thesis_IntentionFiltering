		<content>i'm very sad that my pb12 died... instead of buying another sub, i was told i should consider building my own.. can someone link me to a faq or something along those lines? i'm hoping to learn the basics so i can decide if i want to build one myself. also, if you can link to some vendors for amps/subs or recommend some brands i should be considering. thanks!</content>
