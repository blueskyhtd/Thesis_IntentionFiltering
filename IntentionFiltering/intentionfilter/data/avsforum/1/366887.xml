		<content>i know this is the diy section, but there seems to be discussion from time to time about dj sound systems and their gear. i am looking for some great sounding powered dj speakers. majority of the music will be recorded, not live. they are for outdoor use (tailgating) but only need to cover a small area (15' - 20' in every direction). budget is less than $1000 for the pair. thanks</content>
