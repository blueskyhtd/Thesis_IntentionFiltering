		<content>we are looking for an upper-level 52" lcd, and we've settled on 2 tvs: 1) the wl140 (basically the w4100 + the internet video link) and 2) the xbr6 for i know the general difference in specs between the xbr6 and the w-series, but i honestly don't know how much of a difference 10-bit, deep color, etc makes. what am i really gaining over the w if i go for the xbr6? is the quality difference really worth the price?</content>
