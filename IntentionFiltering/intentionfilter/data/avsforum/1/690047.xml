		<content>if you had a choice of u-verse or fios, which would you pick and why. does one have a better long term outlook. i can get fios right now but don't trust the people trying to sell it to me. my mom lives approx. 15 miles from me and just got u-verse but she doesn't know what it really does yet. i saw a few hd channels today and looks similar to her direct tv. i want the best technology but i want something long term. i am happy with my direct tv but video on demand looks interesting. maybe get howard tv, etc.</content>
