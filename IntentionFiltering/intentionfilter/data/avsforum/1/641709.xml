		<content>as i've been weighing the pros and cons of choosing between the polk audio rm10 and buying some bic america speakers to build my 5.1 system, i began wondering: do any of these speakers come with the necessary wires to connect them to the receiver, or should i be buying wires separately? hdmi cables, i know i need to connect the inputs (xbox, playstation, etc.), but i have seen a lot of discussion about speaker wires (and "banana plugs," which i still don't get), and am not sure which wires i should/need to be buying separately. sorry for the clueless post, and thanks!</content>
