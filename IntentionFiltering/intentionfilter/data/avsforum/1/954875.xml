		<content>hi guys, i'm interested in the totem tribe ii and iiis mainly for movies and sports. i did get to audition them and was quite pleased however the place i heard them at couldn't set up the tribes with a blue ray player or anything so i wasn't able to hear them with movie dialog. anyone heard them on movies? and if there's a dramatic difference between the iis and iiis? thanks.</content>
