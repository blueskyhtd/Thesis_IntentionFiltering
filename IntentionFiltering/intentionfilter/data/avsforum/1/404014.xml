		<content>in a few months i plan on buying my first hdtv and i'm obviously going to get a blu-ray player to go along with it. my problem is that i buy foreign language films from europe as well, and unfortunately blu-ray still supports region encoding. i am looking to keep this setup 100% legal, so i'd much prefer to not have to resort to downloading torrents and streaming them from a ps3. other than simply buying two players, one for each region, what other options are there?</content>
