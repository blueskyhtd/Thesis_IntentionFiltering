		<content>i have found only two reviews on-line, both seemed to like it, but other reviews are scarce. anybody purchased one, yet? it is a price i was waiting for the sony's and sammy's to come own to for the super bowl. i have a pioneer 1018ahk w/ energy speakers, so sound isn't important. i have fios and will be getting a ps3 for christmas.</content>
