		<content>well today i'm going to be buying one of these tv's since they are both on sale. until a few days ago i was completely set on getting the d64 but i'm been really leaning on the samsung. it's 2'' less but for $200 less i'm willing to go with it if the pq is better. so which tv is better? thanks sharp aquos lc42d64u http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...47catid=24558 or samsung ln40a550 http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/pro...099946catid=#</content>
