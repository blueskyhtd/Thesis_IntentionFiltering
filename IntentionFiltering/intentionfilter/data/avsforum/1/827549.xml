		<content>as the title suggests, i will be in the market for a 32-37" tv for my bedroom. the set will be primarily used for watching cable tv and dvds. would be nice if it had a atsc? receiver included for getting some hd off of a regular digital cable signal. viewing distance would be 14-18 feet, but the space for the set is limiting, thereby only looking for 32-37". lcd or plasma, i don't care. under $1000.00 if possible. would like to have before end of the year. thanks. mike been out of the loop since i bought my 42" plasma three years ago, so your input would be much appreciated.</content>
