		<content>looking for opinions on these two sets. i have been very focused on the samsung 61a750 for about a month now, waiting for a decent price point. i have seen the mits advertised for about $500 less than the samsung and i am starting to wonder if there is $500 difference in quality. i know the samsung led does not need bulbs, but at $99 each it will take at least 10 years to recover the price difference. i don't care at all about power consumption or "greenness", i only care about pq and reliability. bottom line, is the samsung worth the extra $500?</content>
