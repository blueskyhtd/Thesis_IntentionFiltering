		<content>i am close to making the final order for home theater equipment in my new house. i currently have a velodyne f1500r 15" sealed servo controlled sub. i have had it for a while and it has been great, but this new room is larger than anything else i have had and i don't think it will perform like i want. it's time to step up to something bigger and better. the main area (living room + kitchen) is about 18' wide, 31' deep and a vaulted ceiling up to 12'. this room opens into hallways and other bedrooms etc. i have calculated the entire open area to be around 8500 cubic feet. i have room up front on the screenwall for two subs, and one near the main listening area for near field placement. i am looking for excellent mid-bass as i have bookshelf- type speakers. solid extension down to 16hz is crucial for pipe organ music playback. music performance is paramount. size or looks doesn't really matter; my wife likes this as much as i do. budget is up to ~$2000. diy is not an option so leave that alone. i don't have the time or desire. the next house (3-5 years) will have an ib so leave me alone about it. i don't want to cut holes in this house. i have looked at the submersive, terraform, th-50, dts-20; stuff like that. what say you?</content>
