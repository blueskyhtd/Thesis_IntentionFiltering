		<content>i'm about to order (tomorrow, most likely) a sammy ln52a750 from buydig and the extra warranty is $159. is it worth it? i've never bought an extended warranty on anything other than a car ($400 extra on the price of a charger isn't much to ask). i'm not seeing any posts about problems with his monitor.</content>
