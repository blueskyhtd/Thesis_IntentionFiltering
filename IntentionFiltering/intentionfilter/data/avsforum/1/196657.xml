		<content>i am trying to decide between both of these two 32in 720p lcd's. they both seem comparable to each other (except for the fact that the lg comes with a built in dvd player). any suggestions or advice to push me one way or the other would be appreciated. the reviews on both tv's are excellent so i am trying to find that little extra... to help me decide. thanks for the help!</content>
