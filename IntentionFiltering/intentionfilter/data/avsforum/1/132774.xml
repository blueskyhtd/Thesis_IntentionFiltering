		<content>this will be my second projector,i'm going to be upgrading from an optoma hd 70.i will mostly use it for pc gaming majority of the time,very few movies,mostly concert blu-rays/dvds. the placement restrictions of the infocus wont be much of an issue.i can light control my room too.i can purchase either one within a few hundred dollars of each other with the infocus being slightly more. thanks for any input</content>
