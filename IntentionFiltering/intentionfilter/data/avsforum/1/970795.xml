		<content>i am seriously considering jumping on board and joining the ranks of projector owner, but want to do it wisely. my question is when can i expect to find the best deals? i am willing to wait a number of months to find bargains. - is black friday the best? - later on in the christmas season/year end? - super bowl time? - new model releases? - other? - will the economic troubles cause there to be some extra special deals do you think? of course i realize at some point you just have to go for it because otherwise you will be waiting for ever, but still i would appreciate thoughts and advice on when would be the best time to part with my hard earned money. thanks.</content>
