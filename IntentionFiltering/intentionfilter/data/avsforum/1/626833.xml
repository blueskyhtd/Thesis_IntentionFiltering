		<content>i want to purchase the samsung ln52a630 or ln52a550, but my friend wants me to get a sony because it's "better" and i will be sorry for getting a samsung. the reason why i opted for a samsung was because of word of mouth, internet reviews, etc. what sony model is comparable to the samsung for around the same price? i will switch if it's a better value.</content>
