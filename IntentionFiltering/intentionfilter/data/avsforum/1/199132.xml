		<content>good morning to all. i am looking to purchase a new popcorn machine for my home theater and am looking for some input on what make/model to choose for my application. here is what i am looking for. - a 6oz popcorn machine - warming tray/deck - old-maid tray/deck - stainless kettle - removable kettle - lighted enclosure i'm not sure where to start as for what manufactures are good/reliable, or what models offer the options i want inside a particular make. additionally, i am looking for opinions on where to make my purchase . (who has the best deal and best customer service.) also any personal experience based opinions are welcome, as i don't know exactly what i want and could be swayed away from any of the options i have listed above. thanks for your time, mark mokita</content>
