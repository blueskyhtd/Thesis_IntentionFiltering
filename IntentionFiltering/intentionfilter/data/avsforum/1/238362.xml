		<content>our 10 year old 29" magnavox is about to die (it's entered the whacking stage), so we're finally going hd this year. our plan is a 40+" tv for under $800, bought from a physical local store (really don't want to risk the hassle of shipping back a defective unit). so far we've found a couple candidates, 1080p with hdmi  vga for $700. we're not really in a hurry, since we're not big tv users (less than basic cable, a couple hours of dvd  wii per week). so we're wondering if better deals are likely as xmas approaches. advice, reviews, other bargains, etc would be appreciated.</content>
