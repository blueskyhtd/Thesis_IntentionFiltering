		<content>hi there, i've searched through the threads but i can't seem to get a full of sense of which screens people are using for the epson 720. i'm looking at picking one up in the next few months and as it is noted as a relative bright projector i was wondering if people are going with white or gray screens. it will be generally used in subdued light and all signs seem to point to me using a gray screen but i was wondering what everyone else was using. your setup details would greatly be appreciated.</content>
