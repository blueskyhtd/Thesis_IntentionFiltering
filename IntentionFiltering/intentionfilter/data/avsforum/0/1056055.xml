		<content>hi all first time here .. hoping someone can help me out. i have a benq pb6100 projector. it`s been great for 3 years, but now i`m seeing a blue hue all over the projected image, no matter what input source i use. benq doesn`t have any support so i thought i`d try you guys .. does anyone know what might cause this ? (my bulb has only 900 hrs, incidentally) i appreciate any help ! :-) thanks, mike nh --------------------</content>
