		<content>my old pc just died so i think i want to move to vista and dual connect it to my monitor and home theater. problem is i didn't run (and can't easily or cheaply) hdmi so i'd like to use component to my projector. will blueray with vista work over component. even if it doesn't i can still view dvds over it. i've found links and post about general budget htpc but i don't see much about using them with component outputs. if i use component could i dual connect it to my monitor (vga) when i don't need/want to fire up the projector? also if anyone wants to list their shopping list for a good budget system, i'm listening. most of the post i've found are a few months old and we all know how much prices change. hoping to spend around ~700 thanks,jb</content>
