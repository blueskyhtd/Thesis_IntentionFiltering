		<content>all, i purchased a home in july that was wired for sound. the speakers in the br stopped working recently. i have played with the connections to the receiver and everything seems to be working properly there. is there a way to test whether the signal is reaching my speakers to determine if the problem is my speaker or the wire? thanks.</content>
