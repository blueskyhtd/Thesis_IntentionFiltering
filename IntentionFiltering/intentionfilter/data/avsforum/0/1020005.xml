		<content>i want to get a nas which has at least 2tb of storage, and it will have all of my 1080p/720p videos on it. so my tv/router setup is the following: living room has my tv/popcorn hour (pch) and office has my router. i will have to use a wireless setup regardless. where should i put my nas? can i put my nas in my living room and connect it via usb to the pch for better speeds? i would also use some type of router/bridge to connect the nas wirelessly to my router in my office. or would a wireless solution be better by putting the nas in the office? and streaming the videos off the network? what should i do?</content>
