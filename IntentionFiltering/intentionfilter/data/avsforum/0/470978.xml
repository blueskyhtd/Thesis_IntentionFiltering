		<content>i just replaced the color wheel on my samsung 46" dlp. i appear to be having the famous color shadowing issue that has become synonymous with this replacement. i updated the cca values (x,y) based on the sticker that came with the new wheel, but there were also lv values that i was unable to locate in the service menu. as a result the color and shadowing still looks bad. attached is the sticker that i received.</content>
