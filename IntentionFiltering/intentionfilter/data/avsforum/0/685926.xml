		<content>i set all my mains to a 100hz cutoff point, but i have no idea what i should set the lfe to. i own an onkyo htib system, which offers a more adjustable speaker setup menu. some i heard let you choose speakers to be set to small, or large and that is all you have to do when it comes to adjusting the frequancies. i wished it was that easy using my receiver.</content>
