		<content>i have a samsung t5687s dlp and whenever i watch it, i see green lights flashing on some edges. it's really hard to explain, but it seems to happen between frames, on the edges where a light color meets a dark color. sometimes i'll also see red flashes too, but not as often as green. it also seems to happen when i look from one side of the screen to the other (while my eyes are moving). is there something i can adjust to get rid of this? i remember seeing the same thing on my old roommates rca 50" non-dlp, but it's not as bad as mine. definitely puts a strain on my eyes. please help! i don't want to have to send this thing back.</content>
