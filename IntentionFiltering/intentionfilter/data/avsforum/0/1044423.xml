		<content>well, im all set to pull the trigger on my new tv purchase. i was set on the sammy but i found out today that i can get the sony w4100 for about $50- more. i know the sony is newer, but in reality which is better?? i have read the cnet review about the a650's and i know they are terrific tv's, but i cant help to think that the sony is very good too. i know it does not have a 10 bit panel (i hate that) but besides that, what would you get?? i need to make my decision today before they run out of stock. please help!!......</content>
