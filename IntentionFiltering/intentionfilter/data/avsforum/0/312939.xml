		<content>i am still worried about letting the sony blu-ray player to run the break in dvd over night or while i am at work uninterrupted on my pioneer elite 101. i am wondering if it is okay to run the break in dvd iso image on a computer hooked up to the panel via hdmi and connected to a uninteruptible power supply? has anyone done it before and is it ok to go that route?</content>
