		<content>i purchased two of these this month, from 2 different locations. boxes look identical in every way except one has an "a" tacked onto the end of the sticker on the side, making it th-50px80ua. i assume there's no difference or reason to choose one set over the other? or am i missing something? is there anything else i should look for as far as which to keep (is a more recent manufacture date/serial number better or worse, etc)? i know this is a popular set, was hoping someone may be in the know. thanks.</content>
