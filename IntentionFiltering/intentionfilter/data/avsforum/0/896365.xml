		<content>greetings all. i bought a pair of mirage 550's (not the omni's, the older set) from ebay last year. great set of speakers...but.... last night i noticed that the left speaker wasn't working barely at all. there is the tiniest bit of sound coming from the tweeter but barely. i switched out the speakers and when attached to the right side speaker wire produced the same results. i even switched out my vintage harmon kardon 730 for my surround sound sony amp. i took out the tweeter and inspected all of the wiring, everything looks good...anyone know what this could be? there is absolutely no sound coming from the sub...</content>
