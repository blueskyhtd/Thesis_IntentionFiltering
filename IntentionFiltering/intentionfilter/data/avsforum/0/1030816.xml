		<content>i have just bought a western digital wd tv hd media player, my problem is that it freezes on the main menu, at first i thought that the batteries in the remote were flat, but when i eventually managed to get to the movie files it played them no worries, and the remote worked fine, it just seames to have a big problem getting past the main menu.</content>
