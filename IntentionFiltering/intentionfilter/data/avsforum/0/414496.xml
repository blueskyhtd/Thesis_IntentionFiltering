		<content>we're familiar with the wect wilmington issue, where the digital coverage was less than its old analog. and, i thought i read somewhere that this situation may be possible with 15% (?) of stations. how about a list of notable examples? here's one for starters: ktvo ch 3 kirksville mo (abc) 100 kw at about 1100' analog ch 3; 87 kw about 1000' digital on uhf ch 33. coverage radius shrinks from about 65 mi to about 45 miles.</content>
