		<content>my htpc has let me down getting a signal from the htpc to my onkyo receiver, so my last resort is a vga-s-video cable (not ideal, i know!). however, the cable im contemplating states "your vga card must support tv out directly through vga port function". but i dont know my the motherboard i am using (asus p5ql-cm) support this. does anyone know if it does, or how i tell? thanks</content>
