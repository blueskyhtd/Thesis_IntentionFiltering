		<content>i'm running xp pro with nvidia 8600gt. most of the content i watch is 720p mkv files (to play them i use the latest coreavc codec with haali) when i run these files with the default renderer of media player classic, dark scenes look great on my plasma screen. when i use the vmr9 (renderless) renderer instead, there is a noticeable improvement of the overall picture in terms of sharpness, depth and better look. but, when using vmr9, dark scenes just don't show all the details, the separation is bad, i get a much better view with the default renderer. since i like the overall picture received with the vmr9, i want to ask if there is something i can do in order to improve the visibilety of dark scenes with this renderer (or maybe you have a different suggestion).</content>
