		<content>242t from olevia from target with 1080p lcd or pn42a450 from samsung costco 720p plasma (two year warranty included) basically the same price i have never owned an olevia, and thought it was not a very good brand, until i saw the reviews. i have also never owned a samsung. i have owned vizio and it is great, but i want to go from 32" to 42" does anyone own either of these tv's, or have any recommendations? also, i have only owned an lcd, never plasma. i have read quite a bit about the newer tv's not having to worry about burn-in, but is that the case with all of them? i watch alot of tv, and i don't want to ruin it. i am playing xbox 360, ps3, watching blu-ray on the ps3, and have a hd-dvr.</content>
