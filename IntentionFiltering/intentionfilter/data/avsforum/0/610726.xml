		<content>problem: two dvd recorders (1 zenith, 1 jvc) on two branches of the main cable splitter. both set to record e.g. letterman at 11:30. intermittently, *both* stop recording simultaneously after ~5, ~20, ~40 minutes. some days the whole show records. there's no external evidence of ac abnormalities. could this be a problem with the cable feed? (time warner customer support is so far clueless...)</content>
