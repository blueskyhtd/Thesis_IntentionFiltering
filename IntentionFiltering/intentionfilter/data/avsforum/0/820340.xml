		<content>i have an external hard drive hooked up to my samsung television. i constantly update my external with new photos and videos, but the television still recognizes old file names and deleted files. i have 75 gigs of media, is it that it takes a while to refresh? or is there a another option to speed this up? thanks so much!</content>
