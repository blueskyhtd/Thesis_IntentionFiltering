		<content>circuit city online has gotten the new panasonic players in a bit earlier than expected and the first orders are shipping today. those that opted for "express" shipping (like me ) will begin receiving players on tuesday the 14th. it is time for a new owners thread. i have owned the previous panasonic bd30, as well as numerous other models. i currently have the lg bh200 and ps3 in my system for comparison and i'll be posting my comments on the new panasonic bd35.</content>
