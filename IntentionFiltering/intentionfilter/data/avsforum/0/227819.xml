		<content>i have been looking at specs and pictures on onkyo's site as well as popular authorized online dealers. in almost all cases the text specifies 4/1 hdmi but the pictures show 3/1. the world's largest online book seller says it is in stock and ready to ship so hopefully someone will have one soon to verify what it really is.</content>
