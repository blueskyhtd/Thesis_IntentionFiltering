		<content>does anyone know if this is true? i'd really like to build an htpc, but i don't need an additional computer if it can't double as a pvr... what do i need to tell verizon? the rep was adamant that without one of their boxes, there's no way i could watch tv (from both a technical and non-technical standpoint). thanks!!!</content>
