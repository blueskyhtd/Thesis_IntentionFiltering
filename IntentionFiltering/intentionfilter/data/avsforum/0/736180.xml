		<content>i think it's coming soon. asus usually doesn't have a hint of product info until right before the release: http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=25l2=150 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55modelmenu=1 http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1...55modelmenu=2 no drivers yet though. any thoughts on when this is pop out of asus? has anyone else noticed the added product page? i'm almost certain that by now, the 4000-series ati cards will have only limited lpcm with no pap and so no different than the analog i'm using now.</content>
