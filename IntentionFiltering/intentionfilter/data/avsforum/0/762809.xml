		<content>i bought an elite and i have a problem with the optical out. i can't fit my component cord and my hdmi cord in at the same time. i was wondering if i could use the cord that came with it that is thinner than my component cord then plug in my hdmi at the same time. will this mess up my xbox. i think the cord that i am talking about is this cord ... http://www.xbox.com/en-us/hardware/x...60hdmiavcable/ does this cable come with the elite? also which cable do i plug in first, the hdmi cable or the audio cable. could this possible mess up my video coming out of my hdmi cable... like a green or red hue? thanks for the help...</content>
