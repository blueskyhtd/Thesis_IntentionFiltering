		<content>i just got this tv and i can't seem to find a thread on how to properly set it up or calibrate. is there anything i should do before i hook up it and turn it on? or can i just start watching tv right now (btw i already have hi-def and have had it for several years w/ my old dlp). i know the first 100 hrs are crucial for plasma tvs, is it similar for lcds?</content>
