		<content>i don't have a massive collection but i do have about 600 movies with cases and it's over running me. i have ripped them to the computer and will need to access them occasionally as i find which ones may not have ripped properly, or if i need to play it somewhere else in the house where i don't have an extender. i have them in open racks right now and having to dust them is a pita, and now that they are stored on the server, i won't need them out in the open. i would like to have them in drawers or shallow tubs with lids and could possibly build a rack for the tubs and put them in my storage area out of the way. i don't know.... i'm wondering what others are doing with their collections and how they are storing them once they have them ripped?</content>
