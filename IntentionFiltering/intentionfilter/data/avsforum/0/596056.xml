		<content>hi, i'm using a philips srm7500 rf remote with vista media center, and i just installed arcsoft totalmedia theater in order to be able to watch hddvd/bluray. the problem is, when i start arcsoft from inside vmc, the buttons on the remote don't work. i know is most likely as issue with the philips remote software that is very mediacenter specific, but i was wondering is anyone uses this remote and has this working before i waste alot of time on trying to get this working. thanks in advance.</content>
