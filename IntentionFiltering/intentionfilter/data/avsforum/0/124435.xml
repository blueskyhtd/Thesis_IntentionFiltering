		<content>hey guys, penteo is finally coming together as my full time job. just this week i filed the paperwork for llc incorporation and got the space at the october audio engineering society show in san francisco. i'll be showing both penteo and sontrio, the 3-point surround subset of penteo. i'm also working on pulling together an event for the saturday night at a well-known san francisco disco, to demonstrate 1970s and 80s classic dance music in 3-point surround. as always, thanks to all of you who have downloaded demos and given feedback. -john</content>
