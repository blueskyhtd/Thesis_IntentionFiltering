		<content>hi, i've been lurking on these boards for 1.5 years now. i appreciate everyone's input and and documentation of their theaters. it's time for me to get involved now (both asking questions and helping others out with any insight i can provide from my experiences). now for my question (after some backgorund). due to existing hvac ducts and plumbing, i will not be able to easily create a sealed box and add soffits within. would it be better/easier/cheaper to frame the soffits to the existing framework and then decouple the drywall with rsic-v, or somehow try and decouple the soffit framework with rsic hangers, and attach the drywall directly to the soffit framework? thanks, matt</content>
