		<content>i swear this drives me insane... why do you always see fp tvs mounted 5-7ft in the air? i can't tell you how many people put them above fireplaces or just high on the wall.. what is it, 50% or more of lcd and plasma owners? who wants to stare up at a tv like a security monitor?</content>
