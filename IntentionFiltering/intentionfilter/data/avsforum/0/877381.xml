		<content>so, i've tried this and it didn't immediately work. has anyone here figured out a way to get the 360 to output component and hdmi at the same time? i pried the casing off of the the comp cable so that both cables would fit at the same time. i get optical audio out of the component dongle and "hdmi->dvi" video out of the hdmi port. i set both output with either cable to 1280x720 thinking that might make a difference. no dice. so, i'm thinking this is a fool's errand and i just need to spend some more cash on an hdmi splitter to get the signal to the downstairs and upstairs tv's. i was just looking for a "free" solution.</content>
