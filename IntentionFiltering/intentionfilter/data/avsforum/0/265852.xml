		<content>ok. you experts... you are me. you got a great deal on the following kit! panasonic th42pz85 42" plasma panasonic bd30 blueray player sony dav-hdx475 1000 watt 5.1 home theater in a box bd30 hdmi to the tv via hdmi was the easy part. now you have to hook em up for best audio. option 1 - optical out from bd30 to the sony box in bitstream mode with secondary set to off in the bd30. option 2 - optical out from bd30 to the sony box in pcm mode (default out of the box bd30 setting) option 3 - hang the sony kit off the optical out on the pz85 and leave the bd30 in pcm mode option 4 - hang the sony kit off the optical out on the pz85 but set the bd30 to bitstream. curious what others would do in this case. c.</content>
