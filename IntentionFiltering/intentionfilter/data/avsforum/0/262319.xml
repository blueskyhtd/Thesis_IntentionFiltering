		<content>i thought with the latest firmware the ps3 would turn off automatically after downloads have finished from the psn store. well i can't find anywhere to activate this. i have looked in the energy saving settings in the main settings section but it only gives you option to turn off if unused for 1 hour or more. any ideas? tboy</content>
