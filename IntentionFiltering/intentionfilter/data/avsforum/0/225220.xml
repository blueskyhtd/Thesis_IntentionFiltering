		<content>i have two tvs, and old 32" crt with s-video in, and my mitsubishi 720p 1500 projector with hdmi in. i want my upcoming htpc (assuming it will be mythbuntu) to drive them both, because i try to limit using the projector. and my kids watch all their stuff on the 32. is there a vid card with both hdmi and svid out that will work? hopefully something that can display on both at the same time. i don't want to have to toggle between the two video outputs. matt</content>
