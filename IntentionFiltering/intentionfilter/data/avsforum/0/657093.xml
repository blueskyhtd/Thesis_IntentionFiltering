		<content>i've just watched the r2 copy of "the texas chain saw massacre" the beginning and there's a very faint line that runs across the top of my lcd screen about 2 inches from the top. does anyone know what's caused this? it shows up both on my blu ray player and my dvd player. i tried another disc after but it's not there. so that leaves me to believe it's either on the disc (perhaps something to do with the 1:85?) or my tv. does anyone have any idea's? thanks.</content>
