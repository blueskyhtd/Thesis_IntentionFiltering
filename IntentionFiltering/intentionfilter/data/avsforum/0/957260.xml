		<content>hello. i posted this question in the hdtv technical forum, and someone replied saying i should post the question in this forum rather than hdtv technical... so here goes (sorry for the re-posting of the same question, i couldn't figure out how to delete the other thread): i recently purchased the samsung ln52a650 and a marantz sr5002 av receiver. i've hooked everything up, running an hdmi from my xbox to the receiver and the cable box to the receiver. everything is hdmi. i get video on both the tv and the xbox, but no audio. the marantz controls are pretty different from other receivers i've owned in the past, and i can't seem to find why my audio isn't working from the tv or the receiver when i have it running that setup. if anyone can tell me what i've done wrong. perhaps there's a setting that i need to enable, or maybe this receiver just won't work for my setup? thanks in advance for any help! ~will</content>
