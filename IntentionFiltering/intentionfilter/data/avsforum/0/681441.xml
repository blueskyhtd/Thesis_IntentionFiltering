		<content>ok, here's my dilemma. i want to move everything over to a good looking htpc case that doesn't break the bank and have narrowed the choice down to either the thermaltake dh101 or the silverstone lc16m, but can't decide and need a little help. also, would both of these fit a diamond radeon 3850, sycthe mini ninja and the lg ggc-h20l bd/hd dvd combo drive? i'm also open to any other suggestions! thanks in advance!</content>
