		<content>i heard the bose truelife demo yesterday at cc. at $1799 it is way out of range but for $999 acoustimass 10 speaker system sounds ok. my question is: can i beat this system's sound quality/clarity/setup/price by going with other brands like polk, klipsch (onkyo or pioneer). please suggest some setups. anks</content>
