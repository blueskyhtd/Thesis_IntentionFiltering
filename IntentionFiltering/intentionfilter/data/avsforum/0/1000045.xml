		<content>i just got an intersting call from the dealr offering me thier demo room runco rs1100 vs the marantz vp-15s1 i did a lot of home work to decide on the marantz and really did not consider the runco during the process. since he threw this option into the miz i wanted to ask the experts (*arn't we all :-)) here should i stay with my initial decision or given he is offering a projector which only has a few hours on it and is about 5k more than the marantz, that the runco rs110 (not ultra), is the better deal help as i need to make a decision tonight if i am going to meet the install date i need thanks in advance !</content>
