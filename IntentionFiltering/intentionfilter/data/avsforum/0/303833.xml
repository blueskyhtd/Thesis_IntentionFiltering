		<content>i was on the emptek website and noticed that they have their ew on-wall speakers on clearance for $99 each. i called and spoke with one of their sales people and he said it was a limited buy and that they are closing out their remainng inventory. the review on the emptek website is good and i noticed that audioholics gave these speakers a good review. has anyone heard them? thanks odd-e-o</content>
