		<content>hello, probably a basic question for all web gurus. which site has the biggest range of music in lossless format. is it still itunes or has someone else taken the number 1 spot? if its still itunes is much of their collection now available in alac/lossless? if i download songs in alac format do i need to worry about drm when ripping cds or copying these to a backup drive etc? thanks for any help offered. sincerely, -dollarman</content>
