		<content>i have a us tv and want to connect it to my sky box atm the tv goes its going through my media center via hdmi which in turn connects to my sky box but i want to connect it directly to the tv. my tv is hp lc2600 (specs on amazon) when i try i only get a black and white signal, would upgrading to sky hd fix this problem? since the tv has a hdmi socket. thx graham</content>
