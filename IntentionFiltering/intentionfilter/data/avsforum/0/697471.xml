		<content>group: pardon me if this question has been asked already. for the first time today, i tried to play a blu-ray disk on my computer. i have a sony sxrd 60" tv with one of the hdmi inputs connected to a radeon (diamond) hd 3450 video card on the pc. i've got the full windows xp desktop coming out properly on my tv. i launch the arcsoft (a demo version i downloaded yesterday from cnet and installed) media player. no problem. i put a br disk in the drive, after twenty seconds or so, the media player starts playing a short video clip and goes for 2-3 seconds. then it stops. the message: "your system is not compatible with hdcp, bd playback is disabled" comes up. so i know the video card is hdcp-compatible. there must be some enabling of this that i haven't done yet. what do you who are observing this forum suggest i do to fix this? thanks in advance. rlowell</content>
