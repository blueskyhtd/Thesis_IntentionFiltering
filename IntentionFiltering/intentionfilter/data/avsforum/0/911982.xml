		<content>hello, i am looking for a solution to turn a art niche (3' x 6' barrel ceiling feature) into a sky. the niche already has fiber rope and looks good. a sky or even italian themed ceiling feature is what we are after. if i could dim the lights down a star ceiling could even come into play? any ideas-do not want to pay 700 + for a graphic vynil but more like a wallpaper in sections. thanks, tyler</content>
