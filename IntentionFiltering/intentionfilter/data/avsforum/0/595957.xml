		<content>refering back to the old de article in ht builder, the riser can be used as a broadband bass trap. apparently, it can be used as a helmholtz resonator as well. i'm just interested in the nonspecific broadband basstrap possibilities. the riser is 14.5ft wide x 8ft long x 12 inches high. it is filled with r38 insulation and is to be covered with 3/4 inch tongue in groove osb glued and screwed. no buttkickers, no sub on the riser. the original de article has roughly 9 openings cut out into the top of the riser along the sidewalls and backwall. these openings are covered with 4x10 inch vents. is this technique still in vogue/valid? should the naked fiberglass exposed by the 9- 4x10 openings in the riser top be covered with gom or other fabric to minimize the chance of glass fiber floating out into the room air?</content>
