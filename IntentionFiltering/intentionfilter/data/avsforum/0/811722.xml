		<content>i just bought the 1080ub. the convergence is definatly off. one green here, one red here, etc. esentially - all the lines on the grid have a red/green companion - probably about one pixel each. i guess my question is how picky should i be? how perfect should i expect that it can be before sending it back. thanks much</content>
