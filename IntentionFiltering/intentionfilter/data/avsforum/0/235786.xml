		<content>i have a friend with a ps3 that would like to use it as a media player (mp3, photos and videos). i was thinking that perhaps installing linux is the best way to get acceptable format compatibility; basically, the only video i want to play are mpg2 avi files that are direct rips from dvd; something the ps3 doesn't seem to like, unfortunately. has anyone tried to do this and had a good experience. i don't care about the lack of hi-def video support; i just want to play ripped dvds, no hd content (i'll use the bd for that). however, i would like broad format compatibility; mpg2 dvd rips are a must, other formats would be nice as well. thanks for the help!</content>
