		<content>hi all - i was literally within days of pulling the trigger on the samsung fp-t5084 when this new model, the pn50a550 showed up - and at nearly the exact same price point. i see that the contrast ratio is double (30,000:1) but aside from that i don't know much else about it. i know there is a pn50a550 owners thread but there hasn't been any direct comparison between these two models. which should i go for? thanks!</content>
