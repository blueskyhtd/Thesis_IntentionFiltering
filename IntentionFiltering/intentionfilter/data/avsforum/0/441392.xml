		<content>my set seems to have a bit of overscan, more noticeable on some channels (hd cable) than others. noticed during the election, that some of the outermost numbers shown on nbc-hd were cut off, and i've noticed text that is close to the edges of the screen may be truncated, although most everything else looks okay and not too obvious. i know how to get in the service menu, but didn't see anything that looked like an adjustment for overscan. is that even adjustable on this set? i can live with it, but i'm a geek and like to get the best from my "toys." many thanks.</content>
