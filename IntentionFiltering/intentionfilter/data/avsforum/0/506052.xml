		<content>i tried all the contenders trial versions last night and every single one of them dropped out of aero when playing a bd and then displayed the blacks incorrectly. i was using the avc disc from http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=948496 to test with. so i could mount the iso and playback as a disc, it'd drop aero and the blacks would be wrong, but if i navigated the disc and opened up one of the 00000x.m2ts files the players would stay in vmr9/evr and the blacks would be correct. i'm really really at my wits end with this crap, why can't they just make it work right.</content>
