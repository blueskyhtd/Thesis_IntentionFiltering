		<content>hey everyone. i've been searching/reading the forums for a while now, but this is my first post! i recently purchased the samsung ln52a650 and a marantz sr5002 av receiver. i've hooked everything up, running an hdmi from my xbox to the receiver and the cable box to the receiver. everything is hdmi. i get video on both the tv and the xbox, but no audio. the marantz controls are pretty different from other receivers i've owned in the past, and i can't seem to find why my audio isn't working from the tv or the receiver when i have it running that setup. if anyone can tell me what i've done wrong. perhaps there's a setting that i need to enable, or maybe this receiver just won't work for my setup? thanks in advance for any help! ~will</content>
