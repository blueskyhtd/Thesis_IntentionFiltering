		<content>well the search was not much help-probably not specific enough. has anyone built some type of box around their ht outlets to control sound? i am thinking that i can build a surrounding box outside the outlet box that is attached to the sheetrock and stud. i would feed the wire through the hush box and into the outlet, sealing both with putty. any pictures? mdf or sheetrock boxes? i could glue sheetrock into a box or mdf. just using putty alone seems like not enough for a dd/gg wall, but maybe a box is overkill? thanks, paul</content>
