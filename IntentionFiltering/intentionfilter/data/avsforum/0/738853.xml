		<content>hey all, i'm at the riser construction point and i don't know which way to go. i originally was hoping to get 8 seats (berk 088s) in the theater but now i'm wondering if i'm trying to squeeze too many seats in. i'm wondering if 6 seats would be better. the theater is 141 inches wide column-to-column and 156 inches wide wal-to-wall. the attached layout shows the two seating configurations and the aisle widths i'd be left with. although i'd love to get 8 seats in there, would it be better with only six? what do you guys think? thanks, andy</content>
