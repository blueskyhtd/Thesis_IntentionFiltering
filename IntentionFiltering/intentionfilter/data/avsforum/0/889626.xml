		<content>here's a list of materials, with their nrc ratings: http://www.atsacoustics.com/page--se...erial--ac.html i gather nrc has to do with overall sound absorption, and i assume a bigger number is better? so why does the 703 have a higer rating than the 705? i thought the 705 was better? and is 0.95 overall a good rating for any type of material? if so, why wouldn't i go with the 2.5lb material at the top (aside from the rigidity of it)? then there's this stuff, which has a 1.05 rating, is it better/worse/virtually the same? http://www.acoustimac.com/proddetail...rod=mnw%2d1260 thanks! -mark</content>
