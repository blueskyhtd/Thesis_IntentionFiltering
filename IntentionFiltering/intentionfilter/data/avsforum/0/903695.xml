		<content>ok, so i'm new at constructing a ht in a basement. i've done several basements, but not a ht. i guess the homeowner has 2 choices? sound quality with no soundproofing, or sound quality with soundproofing. if i construct the interior walls (not facing concrete) via staggered, insul. and double drywall, including double drywall the ceiling- i would be towards having a good sound proofed room and have good sound quality, no? but if the homeowner doesn't really care too much about soundproofing, how would i construct the room for sound quality? not sure if i'm missing something. please help.</content>
