		<content>i'm wondering if someone can help me out - bell's site doesn't seem to have all the options and i want to know what i'm talking about before i go into the store. i'd like to have the following: unlimited five, calling and text to/from 5 #s nationwide text: unlimited or 500 out/unlimited in mms? $30 6gb plan + $10 ipad sharing voicemail and caller id the "regular" or evening/weekend mins don't matter much because it will be almost al covered with the unlimited five package. any help would be great, i am a new customer and have no plan with any carrier.</content>
