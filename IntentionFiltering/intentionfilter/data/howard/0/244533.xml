		<content>i have the iphone 3gs, ipad 3g, iphone 4 and a micro sim adapter. i would like to use the new micro sim from the iphone 4 to use on one of these three devices at a time as i choose. is this possible? i'm aware of the changes to the ipad apn that needs to be made. also, if the new micro sim will not allow me to do it, can i just cut my exising sim from my 3gs and use on the iphone 4 instead? main concern is att detecting and either charging me additionally or disabling data plan on my account.</content>
