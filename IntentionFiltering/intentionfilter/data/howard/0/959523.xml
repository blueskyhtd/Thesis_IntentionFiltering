		<content>bought the samsung vibrant from bell about a week ago and i didn't really bother with samsung kies and always just used the mass storage mode. but now that i heard there's a new firmware update that fixes the gps and increases the battery a bit i need to use samsung kies to update. crappy thing is everytime i try to use it kies will just get stuck on "connecting the device... please wait". does anyone have a solution for that?</content>
