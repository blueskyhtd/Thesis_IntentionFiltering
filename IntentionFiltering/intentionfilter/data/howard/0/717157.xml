		<content>hello, a friend of mine has an iphone and i regularly send text messages to him via xxxxxxxxxx@txt.att.net, from my work email server. last weekend or so i received failure notices from cingularme.com. now he receives several old text (maybe 3 months old) every time i send a new text from my email. i suspect some changes were made on att side and now he has some old texts that are stuck on his account. i am the email administrator for my domain and things look fine on my exchange server. any ideas on how to correct this issue?</content>
