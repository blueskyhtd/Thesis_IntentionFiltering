		<content>i am stoked about my inc. the android system, sense, and even the phone quality are excellent. my only problem is the screen size. i just came from taking a close look at the hd2. the screen! i want that screen! that leads me to the evo. who knows when the shadow really will be released and even then, it lacks sense. here is my question: the sprint rep tells me that when roaming they use verizons towers?? that should make coverage as good (or better?) than verizon. my home looks to be in a roaming area. any info on this would be of great help. thanks!</content>
