		<content>so telus tells customers that they need money for one thing and then they don't do it then want to use it for something else - how scuzzy can a company get? is that not fraud? http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe...rticle1292670/ the phone companies themselves also asked for a reversal of the crtc ruling, because they had earmarked the funds for other purposes. the surpluses, the accumulation of about four years of customer overpayments, followed a 2002 effort by the crtc to encourage competition in the local phone services market by making monthly rates high enough to attract new entrants. in effect, a cushion was built into the rates, but in return, the country's phone companies were told to park some of the extra money in deferral accounts.</content>
