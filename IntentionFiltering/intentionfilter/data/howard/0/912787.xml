		<content>this is my work email. ok, i have read many threads on microsoft exchange accounts and corporate vs non corporate accounts. my confusion is...you guys say you can not set up an exchange account, but i think mine is an exchange account. it is set up, i can recieve and send new emails just fine, but when i press reply and type an email and then press send it wont send. it puts the reply in an outgoing folder. when i try and send the out going email i can't. is ms office outlook an exchange account? how do i tell? or is it imap or pop3? to add to my ignorance - at home i connect to ms office outlook account via the internet at home, (webaccess.si.edu) + password, that is how i set up the account. is that correct? i tried to talk to my it guys and they wouldn't help. (we do not support smartphone email usage they said). thank you,</content>
