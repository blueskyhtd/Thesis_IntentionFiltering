		<content>today i called about my tour's trackball problems and cs is sending me a brand new bold as they are out of tour's. you can imagine how disappointed i am...of course i am kidding. another family member is about to use their ne2 and get a bold. i was wondering if it would be possible for me to give them my new phone and for me to use their upgrade on a droid. how would this work for things such as insurance or warranties? would it make a difference if i did not activate it when i receive it? i don't think it would be right if their new phone didn't have the warranty or insurance. i would just keep mine. thanks for any replies i receive, i figure this is a good place to ask since i know there are a lot of knowledgeable employees/customers who would know these answers.</content>
