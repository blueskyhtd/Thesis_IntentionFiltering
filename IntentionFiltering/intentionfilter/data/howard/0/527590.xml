		<content>i am looking to dump verizon mid-contract to save with straight talk's unltd plan. i am in the 14519 area code and the r451 looks like my best option but when i ask st if i can sync it i get the feeling they don't know what i am talking about. since i get the tech run-around with verizon this isn't any different, but i do need to sync to outlook with ease. thanks for the help.</content>
