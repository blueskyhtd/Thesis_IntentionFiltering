		<content>for those interested in the highly anticipated "google phone". the specs were a bit fuzzy before, but it's been confirm that it only has 3g for aws (t-mobile us and wind). so it won't work on telus or bell at all and only 2g on rogers/fido and att. it's also missing multi-touch. http://androidcommunity.com/google-n...maps-20091218/ http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/18/g...ks-multitouch/</content>
