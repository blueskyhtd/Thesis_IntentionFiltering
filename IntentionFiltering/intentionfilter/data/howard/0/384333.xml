		<content>i have to sway's and both have started to started to beep and then hang up during a call. (3 sets of 2 beeps really fast) one sway did it once last week (son doesn't talk on it much 15 mins a month) and mine has done it twice one last week and once today (i use about 300 but most at once like each call would be 40 minutes) i'll talked to verizon about different problems before and they only give me warranty replacements. what do i got to do to get a good working phone? i've had 2 sways and my son is on his 3rd. i would be willing to extend my two year contract starting now (signed it on 18th of may of this year) and pay the difference for the new phones. please help me out!</content>
