		<content>this is completely brand new in box; i haven't even opened the package (very tempted to though...) asking $640 cad firm, local pick up in downtown toronto only. i will open this up in front of you so you can see it's 100% bnib. all original receipt and accessories will be included of course. however, i do need to keep the sim card, so if the sim card is already inside the phone, you'll need to let me take that out. thanks,</content>
