		<content>when i bought my nokia e71x with the 450 minutes and pda personal plan i was told that i would not be able to send or receive text messages unless i also purchased a texting plan so i bought one (200 texts for $5.00). would i be able to drop the the texting package and just pay-per-text or do i really have to have one?. - steve</content>
