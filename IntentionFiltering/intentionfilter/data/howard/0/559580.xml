		<content>i have a brand new in box iphone4 32gb for sale! it's contract free and factory unlocked. this means you can use it anywhere in the usa (or world) where the iphone band is supported! no more crazy roaming fees, just pop in a prepaid card when you're abroad and have cheap iphone usage! don't be that guy on the news with the $8,000 roaming charge bill! this will work on t-mobile in the usa asking $1,200 usd shipped.</content>
