		<content>hello, my a1200 wont connect to the internet - my plan is with rogers and i have inputed all the information from rogers, that is also indicated in these forums, and still nothing... i have also done a master clear and a master reset and nothing. i see that i am connected to the apn (i think) because there is a green bar under the g on my main screen and in settings, it says i am connected, but still no browser opening... ideas?</content>
