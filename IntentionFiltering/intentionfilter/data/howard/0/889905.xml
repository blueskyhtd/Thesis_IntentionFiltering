		<content>the wireless wave store i deal with in vancouver says that the iphone 3gs is on an "exclusive" deal right now and cannot tell me a date as to when it will be available to their dealers (ie. wireless wave). can someone confirm this as well as maybe give a date as to when they might be available to all of bell's dealers. thanks in advance!</content>
