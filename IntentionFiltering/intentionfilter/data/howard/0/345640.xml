		<content>since t-mobile has 3g in all it's major markets couldn't it brag locally that it has the fastest 3g for the time being? i herd vzw is the slowest 3g anywhere no matter what phone or kinda connection you have... no? im not sure about sprint but since att is the "fastest" but not really, in nyc couldn't t-mo take those bragging rights? if a speed test was done today in nyc against the iphone and whatever tmo device that gets the new 7.2 wouldn't tmobile come out on top? wouldn't that happen in a bunch of markets where att and tmobile both have 3g coverage? so even though att has the "fastest" network, it doesn't perform that way and t-mobile would outshine it right? or am i wayyyy off?</content>
