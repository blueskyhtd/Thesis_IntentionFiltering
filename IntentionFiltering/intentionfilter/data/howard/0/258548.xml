		<content>ive actually tried this and it seems to work. i recently bought a blackberry pearl flip (rogers) from kajiji and stuck my pay as you go sim card into it. on the sim card, i have unlimited on device browsing and the 1 cent talk and text plan i was surprised to see that upon opening the icon labeled 'rogers mall', it allowed me to completely surf the internet on the flip without occurring additional charges to my pre-paid account and even downloads seem to work. has anyone else managed to do this? maybe its a glitch in the system because i don't believe this is suppose to happen.</content>
