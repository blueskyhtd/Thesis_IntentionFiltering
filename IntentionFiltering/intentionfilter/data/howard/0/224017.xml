		<content>hi, in our next trip to europe i want to use my (soon to be purchased) nokia 5730 as a backup for my pictures. i have sd and sdhc cards that i'd like to copy from 2 canon and 1 casio cameras to the 16gb sdhc memory inside the 5730. i supose the 5730 doesn't have an usb host mode but is there a way to copy the pictures without using a computer ? thanks in advance ! christian.</content>
