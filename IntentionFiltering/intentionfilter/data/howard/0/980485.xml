		<content>i know a lot of people are cutting and mutilating, taping, gluing, etc etc. but seriously, stop with the shenanigans. gizmodo posted about the microsim-shop.com, and their adapter. so i ordered 5. under 20 bucks. i'm giving a few away to friends, and keeping the rest for myself. they fit and work perfectly. price is great, and shipping is fast. i got mine in about a week, shipped from austria. http://microsim-shop.com/</content>
