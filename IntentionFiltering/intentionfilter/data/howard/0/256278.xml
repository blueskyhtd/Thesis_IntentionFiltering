		<content>i have a treo 700wx with winmo5 on it. i just got an htc fuze last night from my new employer, it has winmo6 on it. i have sprite backup on my treo so i have a backup of that phone on my sd card. how can i get at the data in my backup file to get that data over to the fuze? i don't know much about sprite backup, i got it for free a few years back. can i just load sprite onto the fuze, and do a restore? i think the sprite backup backs up the registry and everything on the 700wx so i can't restore all of that to the fuze. i guess i can just backup the calendar and notes from the treo and restore those without backing up the system data on the treo?</content>
