		<content>hi recently i purchased an unlocked gsm a sunno s880 running windows mobile 6.5. my service provider is fido, my issue currently is that i can receive calls, surf the net, send and receive sms but i cant make outgoing calls it just does not connect. i don't know what to do, i went to fido and they said maybe it needs to be unlocked again and i went to two places and they both said maybe i got to manually enter the network code but i dont even know how to do that. any help would be great i really want to get this phone up and running.</content>
