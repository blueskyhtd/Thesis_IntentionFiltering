		<content>i was waiting for a flight out of dallas yesterday and stopped by the samsung kiosk they had in the termnial and they had a verizon branded samsung rogue in the front case. it wasn't turned on, but if they are displaying it at the airport, hopefully they will be releasing it soon. i have the omnia right now and i can't type well at all with the virtual keyboard. i'm hoping the rogue is released before my 30 day window is up.</content>
