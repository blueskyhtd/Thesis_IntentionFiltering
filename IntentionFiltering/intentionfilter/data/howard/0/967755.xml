		<content>hey guys, looks like it's been leaked - the samsung wave (s8500) is coming to bell on july 8th!! (google samsung wave bell for a whole bunch of info!) the price looks like it's going to be $300, regardless of contract length. right now it's retailing at independent stores for about $400... do you guys think the retail price is going to drop after the bell release?</content>
