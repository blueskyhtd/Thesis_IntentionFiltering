		<content>ok since i got the dare last year from time to time. mostly when i'm streaming orb my ev-do connection will drop to 1x. i have to stop the audio and wait for the phone to drop the data connection and ev-do will reconnect. i know it's not a signal issue. i live within 1/2 mile from a vzw tower. i rarely drop to 3 bars on ev-do. does anyone know a fix workaround? it's really annoying when this occurs. i know it's been an issue since the phone came out. i'm shocked vzw never fixed it.</content>
