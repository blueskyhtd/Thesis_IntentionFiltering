		<content>i have been through every setting i can find. for some reason, i am only getting the quick banner notification (about 3 seconds) on the screen when i get a new tweet via witter. can any witter users verify that they are getting an audible tone when they receive a new tweet. i am getting tone, popup, and notification light when i get a new email.</content>
