		<content>i just noticed what i think is a bug in 3.0 on the 3gs. i have mms enabled on my phone which works just great. but i just noticed that now when i send a group sms it sends it as a group mms. that really puts a hamper on other iphone people i send in that group sms who don't have mms installed. is there a setting i am missing, or did i find a bug?</content>
