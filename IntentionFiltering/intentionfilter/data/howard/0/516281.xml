		<content>guys, i have a google nexus one for sale that has the att 3g bands. it comes with the original box and accessories. the phone has an invisible shield on the front. there is a scuff mark on the back side of the phone on the lower left corner and a very very small scuff on the bottom right corner of the phone. the phone works perfectly otherwise. i ship to the us only and don't take trades. i take paypal payments. i will be willing to sell this for $425 shipped due to the small scuffs. the phone is sold as is and there are no returns. please pm me if interested. thanks, y2j</content>
