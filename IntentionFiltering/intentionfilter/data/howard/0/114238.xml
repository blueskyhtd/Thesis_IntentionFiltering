		<content>i ordered a phone from the web store over the weekend, and on monday i received an e-mail from a "web store administrator" saying i need to call in to confirm credit card info and address. well i did and i gave him the cc # after some hesitation because the timing was perfect and the phone number had an elaborate, "authentic" sounding voice mail system. the original order confirmation e-mail did say they might e-mail/call to confirm credit history or credit card info. so does telus really do this? or does this sound like a scam to you? the number i called is a 1-866 number not found on their web site. edit: the number i called was 1-866-488-2709 which seems to be legit judging from this post: http://www.howardforums.com/showthread.php?t=1622445 but seriously, wth?</content>
