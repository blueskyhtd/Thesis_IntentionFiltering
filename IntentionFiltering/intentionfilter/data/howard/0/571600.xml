		<content>hi everyone, and let just say i'm new on here and to this extreme phone-tech stuff. i was hoping that someone could help me with getting my old moto-v551 cingular phone to accept or work with a t-mobile sim chip. i've already lost time and money on scam sites to no avail. thanks a whole lot for anything substantial leading to an actual working phone.</content>
