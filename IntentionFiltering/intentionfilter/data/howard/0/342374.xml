		<content>can anyone tell me the status on the port blocking issue? i haven't seen anything on it for a while and am wondering whether i simply missed it. last i heard (quite a while ago) wind was taking a white list approach (which we all seemed to agree was the incorrect approach), and there were still a number of applications having problems due to this. is that still the case? is wind hell-bent on continuing with a white-list approach? has wind even explained why it needs to do this (which we all seem to agree is unnecessary from a security point of view).</content>
