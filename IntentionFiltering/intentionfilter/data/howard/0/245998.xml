		<content>the micro card from my son's phone lg vx6100 was stolen and i had to buy new one. using adapter i transferred songs on the new card (2g). i inserted the card in to the phone but i cannot play music. if i go to "my music" the old titles and albums are there but cannot be played. if i check the memory card the new card is recognized (it shows it is 2 g card with 1.3 g free pace, the old one was 1 g). what i am i doing wrong.</content>
