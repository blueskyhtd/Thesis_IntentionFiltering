		<content>sorry if this is in the wrong place. i couldn't find a modem section. when i go into the configuration of the modem it says the maximum speed is set to 230400. i am able to change that to a higher number of either 460800 or 921600. my question is: why is it set so much lower than it could go? and what happens if i set it higher? would the modem over-heat?</content>
