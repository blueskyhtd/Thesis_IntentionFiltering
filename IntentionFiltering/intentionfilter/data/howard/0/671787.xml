		<content>hi, i just renewed a 3 yr plan and got a nokia 5800. it's a very nice phone, but have a few questions. 1. i don't have a data plan, and i want to be careful not to accidentally use it. i connected to wifi and did some updates. logs show that it did indeed use wifi and not 3g. is there a way to completely block off 3g and only allow wifi? 2. how do i know whether the connection is using wifi or "rogers internet"? 3. can i browse via wifi? it seems when i try to browse using wifi, i'm directed to a rogers page saying i don't have browsing option on my plan and doesn't let me use wifi to browse. 4. can i flash the phone with a korean language firmware? i took a look at navifirm, but i don't know if there's any appropriate korean firmware available. is it reasonably safe to do if possible? thanks.</content>
