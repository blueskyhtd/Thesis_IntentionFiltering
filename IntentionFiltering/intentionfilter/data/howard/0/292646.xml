		<content>okay, so i went through the trouble of getting a nexus one to calgary, switched over to wind, and now my data won't work. i've entered internet.windmobile.ca as the apn. i've even tried accessing the "special" menu typing *#*#4363#*#* and changing the preferred network type to wcdma only but what i get in each case is a few seconds of 3g connectivity through the browser then lose it almost right away (lose all data connectivity). i was at the wind mobile store and they said their techs wouldn't even look at the issue because: 1. they have bigger issues to deal with 2. the nexus one is not a "support" phone any suggestions? being a guinea pig sucks.</content>
