		<content>i see that bell is offering a very good data plan for the ipad - up to 5 gb every 30 days for $35. however, i don't see anything similar for anyone using a mobile wireless e.g. the novatel u998. i have a netbook, and i would like to use it rather than spending the money on a new ipad. the netbook came preloaded with skype. so here's my question. why can't a person pick up a ipad microsim, and use it in the novatel stick? with adapter of course. then i can browse and make calls from the netbook with skype. right? any reason why it wouldn't work?</content>
