		<content>wirelessly posted (mozilla/5.0 (linux; u; android 2.2; en-us; droid build/frf57) applewebkit/533.1 (khtml, like gecko) version/4.0 mobile safari/533.1) the new droid x is coming out soon. my partner works for vzw corp. we have to do all upgrades/account changes online, can't do anything in store. i'm eligible on the employee account on my line for upgrade july 4 for upgrade at 2 year pricing. does anyone know if i can call in to employee phone team and request they let me preorder for a phone ahead of time if the phones release date is on or after my upgrade date on the 4th? for example. preorder starts fathers day which is june 20th. i can't officially upgrade until july 4. can employee phone team (*611) allow me to preorder if the droid x 's release date is on or after the 4th, or do i have to wait til the 4th to preorder/order? my partner says he isn't sure the policy and said i should call in and ask. figured i'd ask here first... anyone know? thanks for any help!</content>
