		<content>hello, i just got the lg keybo 2 (or env3) and it supports up to 8gb micro sd card. i know there are different classes (speeds) of micro sd cards, (class 2, 4, 6, 10) but at what class is the lg keybo 2 phone capable of? no sense paying more for a higher class if it's not needed. thanks for any help.</content>
