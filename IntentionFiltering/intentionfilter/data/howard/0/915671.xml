		<content>hi, i recently acquired a white 16gb iphone 3g[s] that is locked to bell. at the moment it cannot be unlocked since it's on firmware 3.1.3 and baseband 5.12.01. i am on rogers...so the phone is of no use for me. i would like to trade my iphone 3g[s] for a white iphone 3g[s] locked to rogers. condition: 9.8/10. the phone is in great condition, except for a minor scratch that is hardly noticeable. the phone should be fairly close to the condition of my phone. the phone does not have a box, however i only require the phone. willing to trade with anyone in the gta. (should meet at a subway line or a popular mall)</content>
