		<content>this is for some of you that have been complaining about not being able to get the sim cards for $5 in bell stores without being forced to activate in-store for $35-$50. check your local walmart "in-store flyer" on the website. on the left side, click on "connection centre". first page, bottom left. http://www.walmart.ca/wpscontroller?...1language=en# the price isn't on the flyer but i can confirm that they are $10 and will not force you to activate in-store! enjoy!</content>
