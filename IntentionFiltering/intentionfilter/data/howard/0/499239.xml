		<content>so far there has been word that bell, telus and rogers will get the bb torch (portrait slider keyboard + touch screen) eventually, while att will get some period of us exclusivity and an early launch. i have reliable information that the 9800 radio is identical to the 9700's. at time of manufacturing, an irreversible firmware change is made that locks it into either umts 850/1900/2100 or umts 900/aws/2100. except in the case of dev phones which can be set to penta-band, or can be reflashed to the other bands. so... it is technically feasible for an aws-compatible torch to come out on wind. any chance it'll happen?</content>
