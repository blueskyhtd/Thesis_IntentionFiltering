		<content>my phone: env3 with v05 firmware my computer: xp 64 bit with all service packs outlook 2002 lg outlook sync issue: i am able to use bitpim to successfully push calendar and contacts down to the phone from the computer. i would like to try and use the lg outlook sync software so i can have true "sync" between the phone and the computer. when going through the install procedure, all appears to be go properly, but when i complete the install and re-open outlook, the sync button never shows up. i have done re-boots and re-installs to no avail. anyone else seen this problem and discovered a solution? thanks. jp</content>
