		<content>does anyone have any good tips on how to hold the env touch to record video without messing up the audio? i recorded a couple videos yesterday and some where with shell open and closed. i noticed all the videos sounded different and the audio would go from good to bad every couple every so often. i don't know if i was covering the speaker but that might have been it.</content>
