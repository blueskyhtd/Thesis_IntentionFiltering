		<content>is it possible to do a number swap with fido from line a to a prepaid and get a new number on the line a? or do i have to wait 90 days to for the number to be released back into the pool? i called them and they said that this is not possible. i do it everyday for customers at telus, it's called triangular swap or premium swap. fido says this doesn't exist!</content>
