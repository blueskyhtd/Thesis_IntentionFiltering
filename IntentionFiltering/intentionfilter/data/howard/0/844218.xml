		<content>i'm in need of a site which lays out the steps or someone who's willing to write down the steps as my parents need to use this feature right now. i would just tell them how to do it, but i don't have an s60 phone in front of me nor is google giving me anything that doesn't have to do with isync (they're using a pc) or lays it out in simple steps. i want to say they just have to download pc suite and it should be in there...what am i missing? can anyone help?</content>
