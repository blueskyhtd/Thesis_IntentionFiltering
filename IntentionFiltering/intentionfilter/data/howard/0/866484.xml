		<content>i've got a sero $30 plan that expires on may. ideally i'd like to cancel it and port my number to verizon. however that would get me a $200 etf (according to retentions). is there any way i can take my number with my to verizon, and keep the sero plan active for the rest of the contract with another number or do a swap/give away the remainder of the account to someone and get a new number for them?</content>
