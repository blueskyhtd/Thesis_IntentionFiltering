		<content>hi...i recently reset my samsung smooth to its factory settings and now i can't get connected to pageplus. after the reset i dialed *22890 and received a successful activation message. however when i try to make a call it connects to verizon instead of pageplus and says they cannot identify my phone. the home sid is correct and so is the prl. i don't know if the min is correct since i never paid any attention in the past. however, my directory number is correct so i assume the min is also. any ideas??</content>
