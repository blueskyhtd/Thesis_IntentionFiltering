		<content>shouldn't there be some sort of requirement to make an "official" thread? as opposed to "hey, i have no facts to back up anything i speak about (which is fine because a lot of good discussion comes from conjecture) but based on "my information", which is mostly comprised guesses and somehow tying in completely non-related actions by the carrier and/or manufacturer, i'm gonna start an official islate pre-release thread". stop it, please. imo on mods and a couple other people should start "official" threads. rant over.</content>
