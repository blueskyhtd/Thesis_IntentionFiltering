		<content>hey guys, i currently have a basic family share plan with 700 minutes, 2 lines - basic text plans, but really no frills. the primary line was just renewed last week, and i will be renewing the secondary line, adding a third line, and upgrading to a 1400 minute plan in the next few weeks. i've been a vzw customer for 4 years, no late charges, etc. my question is do csrs have any power to offer a better price than what the standard online price is on new equipment with a 2-year activation? anyone had any luck in talking with the verizon folks? any info would be helpful, thanks guys!</content>
