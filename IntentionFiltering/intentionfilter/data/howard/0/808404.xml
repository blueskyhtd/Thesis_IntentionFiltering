		<content>every single time i use wifi at home on my droid 30-45 minutes later, my network will crash. i'm using an apple airport extreme router. i'm almost positive its my droid thats causing it to crash. i can go days without using my droid on wifi and my network is fine. as soon as i access wifi, it crashes, and i have to reboot my modem and router. is there certain ports i need to allow access to on my router? settings i need to change? any help is appreciated. thanks.</content>
