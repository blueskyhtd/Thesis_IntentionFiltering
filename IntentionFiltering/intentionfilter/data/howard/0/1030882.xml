		<content>i changed my fab5, but i think due to either their website, or my laptop, it didn't go thru. i did that last time i looked at my bill which was like..march 18th. i got my bill today, and huuuuge overage (like 600 mins over) from calling 1 number. rogers reversed that no problem for my sister. is bell as forgiving to those issues? it made my bill which is usually $56 with taxes balloon up to $135 :s</content>
