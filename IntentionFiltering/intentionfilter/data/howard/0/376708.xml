		<content>i originally posted this here: wireless advisor but wanted to share. source: sizlopedia samsung ctia event sources report that the sexy looking samsung galaxy s will getting a new home at t-mobile. bluetooth sig has approved this android beauty and has named it samsung sch-t959 following the t-mobile naming convention. we will still be referring it to as t-mobile samsung galaxy s to make our life easier. there appears to be some suspicion regarding the device identity being other galaxy s. specs wise the device definitely looks the one we want with a 4 inch amoled touchscreen, android os and of course samsung's very own touchwiz 3.0 the question here is of course this - will the samsung galaxy be able to do wonders like the recently launched t-mobile htc hd2? t-mobile and samsung folks will definitely be hoping for that to happen again.</content>
