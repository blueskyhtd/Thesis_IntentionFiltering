		<content>i've got a decent plantronics 855 bluetooth stereo headset that i use daily for music and calls. i can't seem to get it to work while on a facetime call. i've tried facetime dialing, direct dialing then adding facetime, switching from being called to being the calling party, and all variations of these configurations. anyone have a possible solution? it seems every facetime call requires that you use the built-in mic for speakerphone setting. i don't know why, since facetime could be very useful in a very noisy environment, but i don't see an option for mic selection like on standard calls with a bluetooth set connected. are we going to need a jailbreak and app for this also? we have two iphone 4's in our household, so i'm open to test any suggestions.</content>
