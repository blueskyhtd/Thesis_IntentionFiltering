		<content>i know in the past that group connect was not offered on boost mobile phones. however, i was told recently that if you switch from a sprint/nextel post paid account to a boost account you can now bring your existing dc number over as well. if so, would that enable me to use group connect as a boost customer? any help is greatly appreciated.</content>
