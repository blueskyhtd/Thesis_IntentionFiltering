		<content>hi all, i'll appreciate some advice on how to deal with the issue of not being able to send emails. i have a nokia n900 and voice/data plan with wind mobile. i have been successfully able to retrieve email messages from my telus email account both via wi-fi and now on cellular data. but i can't send emails, no matter what i tried for outgoing server setting. telus email account is not mobile, it is what comes with my home internet. any advice/help will be much appreciated!</content>
