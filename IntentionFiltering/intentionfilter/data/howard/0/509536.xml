		<content>since about a week or so, i have noticed that when i am in a call, i no longer am able to access the 3g or edge networks on rogers and fido. i have read and searched but i have not found anything. i have contacted rogers and they reset my phone thinking it was a software issue..it has also happening on fido network. is this happening to anyone else?</content>
