		<content>anyone interested in trading their bnib rogers iphone 3gs 16gb for a bnib rogers 9700 bold? your 16gb iphone 3gs must be brand new sealed, and it must be from rogers. proof of activation must be shown with matching imei as i will provide the same for my 9700. if you have a rogers 32gb 3gs, it must be in absolutely mint condition (i'm very meticulous), and with a good length of warranty remaining on the phone. i prefer black iphones. no fido iphones. face-to-face transaction only! i'm located in scarborough. cheers.</content>
