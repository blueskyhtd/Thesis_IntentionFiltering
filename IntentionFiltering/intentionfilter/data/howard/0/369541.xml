		<content>has anybody gotten a weird bug where you're in an app or something in ios 4.0 and you hear the sound that plays for a text message, but you don't get any indication at all about the text? no little pop-up or new text in the messages app? i just got this error this morning while i was playing tetris and still after a few hours haven't received this phantom text on my iphone 3g.</content>
