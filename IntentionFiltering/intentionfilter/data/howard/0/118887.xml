		<content>i'm hoping someone was in the same boat as me and can answer a quick question. i have a family plan with 600 shared minutes and unlimited text on 3 lines. i just added the preferred android plan to my 1st line and got a vibrant for it. one of my other lines is eligible for a phone upgrade and i was wondering if i can get a second vibrant without paying for data (wifi use only). since my unlimited text plan costs $14.99 a month will they let me get the phone discount without requiring me to get a data plan on my extra line? i want the phone i just don't use data that much and wi-fi only will work for me. has anyone done this or tried it?</content>
