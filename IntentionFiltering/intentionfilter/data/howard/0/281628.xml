		<content>i have an unlocked t-mobile samsung gravity i (t-459). how to find a way of changing its grps/wap/data settings? is there some hidden menu or something? more generally, how to (completely) un-brand the phone, remove t-zones, t-mobile mobile backup, etc? if it matters, my gravity was unlocked using an unlock code provided by t-mobile customer service.</content>
