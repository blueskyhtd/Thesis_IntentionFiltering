		<content>hi everyone. i have searched the web high and low and haven't been able to find anything whatsoever about this problem. i don't know all of the technical jargon, so i hope i can make this clear. on the center, round navigation button on the keypad, there is a small, circular piece that sits inside the button itself. mine has dislodged. i still have the piece, and am wondering what would be the best way to reseat the circular piece. the only idea i have is perhaps to use a tiny bit of adhesive, but i don't want to screw up and accidentally glue the keys. it's not a huge deal, but the phone looks better with the little ring, and the button isn't as responsive without it. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. happy holidays!</content>
