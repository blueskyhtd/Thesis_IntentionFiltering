		<content>ok... here is my issue. been going on for about 2 weeks. i get no 3g in the zip code 19038. only edge. i am now not getting 3g in center city philadelphia. so now i can't get 3g at home or at work. this blows. i called att a bunch of times. finally there is a tower in my area that is "degraded" that is the word they used. now i guess i will have to spend the rest of the day calling to get a ticket opened for the philly area. anyone else having 3g issues?</content>
