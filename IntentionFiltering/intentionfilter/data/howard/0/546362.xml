		<content>this is obvious but i thought share my experience with increasing droid battery life. turning off auto brightness and setting to about 40% decreased battery life consumption from 70% of battery usage for one day to 39% the next day. normally my battery is at 15% at this time of the day. its at 40% today. so this one setting is huge improvement and the screen is still plenty bright enough.</content>
