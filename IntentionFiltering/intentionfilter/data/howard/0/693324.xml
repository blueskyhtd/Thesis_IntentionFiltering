		<content>is there a new proxy server required for internet over metropcs? i tried tethering today and got a message that the proxy server is "busy or unavailable". i tried looking for wap.metropcs.net on my desktop and found that there is no dns entry for it. internet on the dinky little phone still works, so i tend to conclude that the proxy server is no longer wap.metropcs.net port 3128.</content>
