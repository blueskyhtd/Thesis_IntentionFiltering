		<content>it appears that 16gb class 2 and class 4 cards are coming pre-installed on the droid x. please check the card on your phone and vote in the above poll. also, please post a reply saying the class speed, date code on the back of the phone, and if you ordered the phone on line or in store. so for example one would say: class 4 25/10 ordered on line. date code is in week/year format: class 4 japan</content>
