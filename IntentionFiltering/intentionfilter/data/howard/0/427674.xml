		<content>hi all, i'm on rogers pay-as-you-go with a 125/mo text package (with a balance of about 100 left, and some money left in the monthly balance expiring in january). as it is, i can send texts to people no problem. but receiving is a very different story. when some people (some on 711 speakout, others on rogers monthly) send my texts, they don't get a delivery report and i don't get the message until very much later, when i get all the messages i was sent together at once. this has happened multiple times. does anyone know whats going on? thanks!</content>
