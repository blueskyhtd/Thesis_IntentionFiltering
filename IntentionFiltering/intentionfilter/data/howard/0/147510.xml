		<content>the engadget review of the nexus one was kind of a letdown. http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/nexus-one-review/ i did find this comment near the end interesting "it's a good android phone, but not the last word -- in fact, if we had to choose between this phone or the droid right now, we would lean towards the latter." surprising comments. something i was not expecting.</content>
