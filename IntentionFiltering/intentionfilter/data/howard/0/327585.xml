		<content>i am like a lot of you out there. i have been a long time sasktel supporter (b/c of the coverage), and for a long time have seen my rogers subscribing friends sporting the latest and greatest phones while i am stuck with whatever phones get converted to cdma. well, i am told this is all going to change. when? not sure. please post to this thread any info you may have regarding the sasktel network upgrade. i am also interested in getting an iphone when it is available on the new network (hey sasktel, keep in mind there is supposed to be a new iphone released this summer - please don't shoot yourselves in the foot and only offer the 3gs).</content>
