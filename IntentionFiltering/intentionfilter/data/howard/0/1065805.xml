		<content>virgin has done it again...the soon-to-be-released blackberry 9800 aka torch aka bold 3 will be available as soon as it hits the canadian market. the highly rumored/awaited blackberry is a mix of a bold 9700 and a storm2 with os 6...very exciting. no pricing available yet...but i'm sure it'll be around the 9700 price range. watch out iphone 4...watch out...</content>
