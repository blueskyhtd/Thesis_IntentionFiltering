		<content>after considerable thought, i have decided to return my phone. despite the beautiful screen and screaming fast processor, the device has some issues that i ultimately couldn?t rationalize. 1. samsung touchwiz ui was a bit buggy which inhibited the android os performance. sometimes apps wouldn?t load properly or perform slowly. os would get stuck sometimes, etc. experience wasn't horrible, but not the performance i expected. 2. handset didn?t transition well between edge and 3g. had problems when emerging from subways, etc. building penetration was also a bit suspect. 3. gps was terrible. probably a hardware issue. just wasn?t sensitive enough. had difficulty logging on to my location. 4. no led indicator for message notification. such a small oversight?. but really annoying not to have. 5. i miss the trackball. i found my old trackball helpful when writing, especially when noticing a spelling mistake. i didn't mind the lack of a camera flash or a front facing camera. the phone just didn't perform up to my expectation. it's too bad because i was counting the days until this phone was launched. (i even went to the launch party in nyc). oh well... by the way, for those of you wondering... i did reset my handset.</content>
