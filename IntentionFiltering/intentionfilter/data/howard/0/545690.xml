		<content>i just got the e71x the other day and so far i'm really happy with it. i got a developer's certificate so i can sign apps, i installed x-plore and removed all the demo apps just fine. there are a few att icons in the main menu that seem to be stuck with no option to move them or delete them. i would like to know if there's a back way into this so i can just delete them. -shop games -shop apps -shop music -music apps i also kept wikimobile on there and can't seem to be able to move it either.</content>
