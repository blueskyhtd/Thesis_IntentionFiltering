		<content>i just activated my telus prepaid account yesterday (cdma) for one reason, to use the $7 unlimited caling to one number. my set up is quite simple: i have a vbuzzer voip number that people will call me through it is forwarded to my telus prepaid account therefore, i have unlimited incoming calling. sounds simple right? i test out the call and it charges me. i turned the caller id pass-through off and it still charges me. i tried 4 different configurations, all of them charged me! does telus have a system in place that knows i am forwarding a call via that number? is there any way around this?</content>
