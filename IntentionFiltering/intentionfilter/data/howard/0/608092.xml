		<content>hey everyone, first post so here its goes.... just got two new criket a100's for my office staff. wondering how i can sync this with my outlook contacts? i have tried data sync but can't find 6.1 for free and im guessing that's the only version that supports this model or the kyocera s1300? also i have tried bitpim but also no luck even when i choose the "other" phone option. i'm sure this must be simple to do i just don't know what to look for. thanks@</content>
