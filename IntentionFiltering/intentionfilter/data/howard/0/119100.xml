		<content>i am wondering if the coverage has improved in the far s.w. ( end of bow trail/wentworth ) yet? it was very spotty a couple of months ago. i see on the wind coverage maps now that there is a red/covered area in two tones of red in calgary? is the darker red supposed to mean something?</content>
