		<content>i have some questions about video recording on the incredible. what is the difference between h.263, h.264 and mpeg4?? i am not sure which to use for the smoothest playback on my phone and computer/ipad. also, do the 3 different resolutions offered (1280 x 720, 800 x 480 and 640 x 480) all have the same fps rate, or are they different. i don't mind recording at 640 x 480 if it's going to give me the smoothest video. thanks for any help and insight.</content>
