		<content>i'm on t-mobile usa, iphone 3gs, using the mms hack allowing me to send and receive mms. for some reason, when i want to send a group sms, once i add a second person in the messaging app, it automatically says "group mms" at the top. when i send them, the other people receive the message as a mms. is this a known bug with 3.0 or an issue if you are using the mms hack? anyone have this happen? thanks</content>
