		<content>all of a sudden bell has added a sub-category to it's new hspa network map. a so-called extended coverage has section which covers a large majority of the prairies and some parts on ontario. quoted beneath the new refurbished coverage map is a disclaimer "roaming partners' hspa and gsm/edge coverage in certain parts of manitoba and saskatchewan. speed may vary due to topography, environmental conditions, device type and other factors." so basically as i understand it this new "extended coverage" isn't hspa at all, it's old 2g gsm/edge network, haha. so what i'm concerned about is bell advertising it as hspa, and the future hspa coverage zones (specifically in northern ontario) to be filled with sub-par old technology which isn't fast at all. sure it's great they have coverage all over the prairies now, but it's the wrong kind of coverage. i think it's unethical to label this extended coverage hspa when it's really gsm... come on bell, pull your heads out of your, well you know your thoughts...?</content>
