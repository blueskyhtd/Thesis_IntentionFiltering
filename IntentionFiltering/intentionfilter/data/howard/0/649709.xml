		<content>i have been using the bell turbo stick around toronto in the last month. download speeds from speedtest.net show i am getting less than 2mbps quite often and around 200kbps on uploads. kind of dissapointing considering they advertise they have the biggest 3g network. my colleague has a rogers stick and see's speeds around 4-5mbps. anybody else getting crappy speeds?</content>
