		<content>i use outlook for corporate email (the email server is mdaemon, not exchange: i use an app called outlook connector for mdaemon and outlook is fully functional). i want to sync my contacts and calendar to the galaxy. from another thread here, i know there is a way to get gmail and outlook working together but i'm not pursuing that right away. so far i cannot find a reliable syncml app for the android-based smartphone, so an "over-the-air" sync is not in the picture. if you know of an app that works, please post! meantime, i will try to use kies as the intermediary between outlook and the galaxy. wondering if any of you have installed and run kies and successfully got a sync going with outlook? if it hasn't worked, i would appreciate hearing about the issues you had. thanks.</content>
