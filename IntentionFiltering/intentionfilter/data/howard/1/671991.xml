		<content>am i missing anything? my wife and i are probably going to get iphones. we are looking at the shared $100 plan. 450 + 50 minutes (shared) unlimited calling between both phones unlimited text messaging (we're picking this option) 3gb shared they are throwing in the standard caller id/vm option for free over 3 years.. my wife and i don't talk very much on the cell phones.. so texting is more important.. she won't use that much data.. i will.. but i don't think i'll burn through 1.5gbs per month.. i hope.. am i missing anything? that is about $50 per phone.</content>
