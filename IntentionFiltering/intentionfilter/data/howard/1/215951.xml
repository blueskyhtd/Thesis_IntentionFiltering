		<content>if i have 2 lines and only 1 of them is available for the upgrade, so i ordered on that line, but i want to really use the iphone 4 on the non-upgradeable line (my line). how will that work with swapping the micro sim ? do i have to get a separate micro sim from the store for my line? thanks</content>
