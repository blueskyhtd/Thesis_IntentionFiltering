		<content>looking to upgrade soon and might have the option of getting a phone with just 850 3g band and wanted to see if there was a way to test coverage locally. my blackjack does both so that doesn't help alone, and if i set it to 850 gsm it loses all signal. that might mean no 850 3g, but wanted to be sure that was the case and if not conclusive what i can do to see signals in the area.</content>
