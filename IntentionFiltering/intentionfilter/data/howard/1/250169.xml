		<content>i can't make up my mind between these three phones. i love the way that the x10 looks, but i don't really use facebook or any of those so the whole timescape thing would be a waste. the beam would be nice b/c i like samsung and the projector would be useful for my kids if they get bored while we're waiting around somewhere. plus, the power tends to go out a lot here during storms. the galaxy s just seems like it will be nice all around. it looks like a fingerprint magnet, but i love the nice video recording that it does. i've never had an android phone before so i don't think i'll really know what i'm missing if i just get 1.6 on the se. i'm on att, but i don't care about it not having 3g.</content>
