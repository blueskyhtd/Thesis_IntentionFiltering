		<content>does anyone know if a version of the galaxy s is going to be released with the att 3g bands? i've heard att is supposed to be receiving the captivate, however, i have no interest in picking up a branded (and most likely crippled) phone. i wanted to purchase an unbranded and unlocked galaxy s that supports att 3g, but i search google and the forums here and found no information about where to purchase one, or if one even exists. it shows on gsmarena.com that there is supposed to be a version of the galaxy s with att bands but i wanted to know if anyone has any information on where to purchase one or if one is actually going to be released and when. thanks!</content>
