		<content>quick question guys, sorry if this has been asked before through searching, i know that an unlocked 3gs 32gb iphone will work on the new bell network with a sim card.......but since i already have an existing bell plan on my lg vantage (non-smart phone, and internet has been disabled) can i just ask them to give me a sim card, and put it in my iphone? no questions asked? and still remain on my old plan?</content>
