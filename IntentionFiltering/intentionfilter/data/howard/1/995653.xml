		<title>adding new line + data to new family plan?</title>

		<content>i am currently with att and looking to switch over to verizon to get myself a shiny new droid. my mom is currently on verizon by herself (just a voice/text, 1 line plan). i would like to add myself onto her plan. how can i do this? from what i've gathered on the verizon website and several forum posts, it looks like my best option is to get the nationwide select family shareplan. $99.99 (that's $90 plus $9.99 for the second line) for 700 shared minutes, unlimited texts. then since i'll be getting the droid, i'll need the $29.99 data plan for my line. she doesn't need data. she has a 20% company discount so ($90 - 20%) + $9.99 + $29.99 = $111.98 plus taxes/fees. am i correct in that this plan is available and will meet my needs? also, it is my understanding that the 2-year contracts on each line are independent of one another; is that correct? that is, my mom's contract still has a few months remaining, but i will still be able to get the droid for $199.99 with a new 2 year contract for my new line, right? and she will still have her contract expire in a few months as usual (i.e. no forced contract extension for her)? thank you for your help. james</content>
