		<content>i need one to use between att in the u.s. and rogers in canada. i just want it to be plug and play (not have to worry about jailbreaking and extra stuff everytime i update it). if i buy factory unlocked i can just update it normally right? is there anything else different about the factory unlocked iphones? i don't care about the warranty, just want to be able to switch my sim card at will. any recommendations on a reliable place to get one? thanks in advance!</content>
