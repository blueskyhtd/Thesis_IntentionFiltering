		<content>i've been interested in the droid/milestone for a while, however, i'm more interested in the htc desire. i wish it had a physical keyboard though, but given the faster processor than in the milestone (1ghz versus 550mhz), i think i'd rather have a desire. has anyone heard anything about either the nexus one or the desire coming to telus or another canadian carrier?</content>
