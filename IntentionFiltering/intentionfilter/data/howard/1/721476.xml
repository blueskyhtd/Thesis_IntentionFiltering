		<content>i'm getting ready to buy one as i've done away with att + the iphone 3gs (love it but too expensive), so i jumped ship to the tmobile and thinking about getting a nexus one. my big question is, what is the battery life like on this device? with respectable backlight brightness (50%) to get the daily pop from the screen but what is your typical battery life like?? also can anyone recommend a good headphone for the nexus one (hopefully pressing a button to scroll to the next song) and what music app to use to play songs?</content>
