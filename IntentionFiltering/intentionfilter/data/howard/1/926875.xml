		<content>apple ipad got announced today (wednesday, january 27th, 2010), along with it's data plan has been announced and its going to be: ~$30 a month for unlimited ~$15 a month for 250mb -activatable/purchasable directly on the device (possibly through a portal) -all plans are prepaid (att gophone) -all plans include free of att hotspots the ipad comes unlocked so that it can be used on any standard 3g network (no 3g when using t-mobile, they didn't follow 3g standards unlike apple) the ipad uses a new standard for sim cards called "microsim" which will be rolling out across all us gsm networks very soon as devices that require them become publicly available ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ so, do you think there will be someway to get this on other gophones or even maybe the iphone? what about tmobile adopting such a data model?</content>
