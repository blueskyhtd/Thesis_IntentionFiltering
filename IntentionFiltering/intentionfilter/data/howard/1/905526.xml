		<content>i called att and i called my local corporate att store. they informed me that if i wanted, i could purchase one of the sim cards that can be cut into a micro sim card. i visited my local att store and they refused to sell me a sim/micro sim outright or to replace my current sim in a blackberry. is this normal policy, or just another case of mis-informed sales people? thank you</content>
