		<content>hey guys, i'm about to order a nokia n900 and i really want to have data on it, i called t-mobile and they have a data only plan/sim that i can get for $39.99 a month. i think it is a bit steep but w/e. is there a way i can add some minutes to the data plan sim? either 100 minutes a month or something or just a pre-paid amount of minutes? the phone will be for data and video stuff while traveling so the minutes would be primarily for situations when i don't have my bb on me... thanks guys, mike</content>
