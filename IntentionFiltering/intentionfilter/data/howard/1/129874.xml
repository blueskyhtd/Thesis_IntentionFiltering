		<content>hey guys - i know there`s a retention sticky at the top, but just a quick question: from your experiences, is it possible to negotiate successfully with retentions before your contract expires? currently, i'm about 9 months out from the end of my contract and i really want to pick up a bb 9700 before then because my htc touch is crapping out on me. however, i don't want to renew without getting some type of bonus. any thoughts?</content>
