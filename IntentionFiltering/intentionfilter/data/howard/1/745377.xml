		<content>what's the cheapest way to get a samsung wave and/or galaxy s as a new customer? i got some friends who are new bell customers too and they were able to get some excellent plans from bell a while back, something that's comparable to my own fido plan in sig. i understand they're smart phones so they both require data plans to get them at the bell and best buy advertised price, but what if i don't get a data plan?</content>
