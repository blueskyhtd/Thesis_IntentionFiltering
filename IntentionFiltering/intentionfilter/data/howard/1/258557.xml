		<content>i am in no hurry to get a new phone, but i was wondering if there was any good super amoled phones (samsung exclusive right?) that are being rumored about for the future and would provide a good middleground for what i want. i really like the wave and its looks, but the screen size is on the small size and it isn't running android. the galaxy s looks too big and i definitely don't like the design or aesthetics. what else is looking on the horizon?</content>
