		<content>this is probably a stupid question to ask, but is it possible to get the samsung galaxy on just a voice plan, and no data? i use wifi a lot so that would be plenty for me. i tried it out in store and i really like it, but this is the only thing setting me back. my contract needs to be renewed soon. if i can't, what's a good phone on bell that doesn't require data?</content>
