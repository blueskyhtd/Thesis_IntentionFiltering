		<content>pretty simple. i have a mint 3gs as described in the post title that's been sitting in a box for three months. it's been unlocked (and updated to the latest firmware). i'm looking to either trade for a telus hero, or buy a hero outright from some enterprising canadian. i can provide pics and anything else one might require if and when interest is expressed.</content>
