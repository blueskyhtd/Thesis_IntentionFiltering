		<content>my wife doesn't really want the htc eris with the data plan so if i was to buy the motorola droid for myself and put the free htc eris on my wife's phone number temporarily for 1 day, would i then be able to switch my wife's phone number back to her old env with no data plan and sell her "free" eris on ebay (clear esn?)? what a schemer i am. this would be too good to be true since both require a new 2 year activation with a data plan.</content>
