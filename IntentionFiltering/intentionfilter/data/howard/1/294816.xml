		<content>just got the droid when it was released but i still have my eye on the pre plus! i know the hardware specs are not as good as the droid but i still love it! is anyone else in the same boat as me? i am really considering switching.. touchstone..multitouch..portrait keyboard...more pocket-able.. looking at one major negative would be going back to: vzw nav</content>
