		<content>hey all, getting the new blackberry bold 9700 so i am selling my iphone. i bought this on the day it launched. the phone has had a screen protector and been encased in an incase slider case since the second it was removed from the original packaging. i will also include a fortte leather holster case that was custom designed to fit the iphone while in its incase. unit is a white 32gb unit and is locked to rogers. i will include a grey incase slider case. the original packaging with everything (including the receipt) is included. unit has been upgraded to os 3.1.2 and has been jailbroken (but i can restore it back to factory state if you wish). this phone sells for $799+tax brand new ($900). i am looking to get $700 flat for this 100% mint condition iphone with screen protector and case and leather holster! i work in downtown toronto and live in the north end but can work out a place to meet! im, pm, or email if you're interested!</content>
