		<content>so i am planning on leaving sprint and getting an att tilt. i noticed the unbranded kaiser has a camera on the front for video calls while the att branded tilt does not. is there any way to get that front camera working on att? say i had 2 of the unbranded kaisers, 1 for me qnd 1 for my wife. is there any app i could install that would let us video chat?</content>
