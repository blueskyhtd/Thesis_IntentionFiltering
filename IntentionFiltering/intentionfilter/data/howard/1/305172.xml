		<content>i have iphone 3gs and i have to shell out $500 for iphone4 and a long wait now. i am really interested if people who have tried both iphone 3gs and google nexus (also $529 and unlocked) one to compare the phones please. on usability, features, accessibility. i have used many htc fans in past, wm phones, symbian etc and fairly conversant with unix/linux. so on geekiness side i know android are great, more interested in direct comparisons from howard forum members who had handled both.. i may take android road and ditch iphone4 altogether for a year thanks</content>
