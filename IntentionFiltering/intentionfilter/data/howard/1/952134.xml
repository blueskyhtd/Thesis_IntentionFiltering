		<content>i am interested in tethering a tm506 with a cradlepoint router. while i have seen mention of this ability on the forum, the specific cradlepoint model is not listed. i have also looked on cradlepoint's website, but could not find the tm506 listed. any recommendations of known working cradlepoint routers to tether with the tm506 to create a mobile wifi hotspot?</content>
