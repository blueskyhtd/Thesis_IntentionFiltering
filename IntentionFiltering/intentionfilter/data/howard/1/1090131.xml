		<content>i have a couple of lines on family accounts and i was wondering if i could chose to port one in to my verizon prepaid? i keep the verizon prepaid in the car for emergencies because of the coverage, will i be able to call in to verizons prepaid customer service and port in a number or would i have to buy a new phone? thanks in advance.</content>
