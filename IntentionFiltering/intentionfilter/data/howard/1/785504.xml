		<content>i'm going to get an iphone but don't know which provider to sign up with as their plans all seem to be about the same. i need about 500 mins local calling, 300 mins long distance (primarily within canada), vmail, call display, 2g data should do it. i have been with rogers for about 15 yrs - never had an issue with availability but their customer service could use some improvement. i have bell landline and tv. can i get some opinions on the other carriers wrt iphone packages? i see that fido has per second billing which is attractive. how can i get the best deal? thanks. rob</content>
