		<content>i couldn't find anything on google or this forum... so i thought i should ask. i currently have an htc touch with a $7 unlimited data plan... i'm thinking of getting an iphone on my current plan. what i don't understand is... will the $7 somehow work on the iphone? i cant seem to wrap my head around how i can download/browse tons on my htc touch, yet with an iphone, i have to pay an incredible amount for unlimited. any knowledge would be appreciated! thank you.</content>
