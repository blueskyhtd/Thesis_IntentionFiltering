		<content>we are looking for official links/procedures to available discounts sprint offers. preferably these will be the most recent ones of course. this has been a common question and it would be of benefit to many if we had a central common thread to which we could edit as new info comes in. the sticky thread will be started/edited once we can establish a common list !!</content>
