		<content>hello all, i was thinking about buying a samsung vibrant (or other android t mobile phone) until i got some bad news. i called a tmobile store(official, not reseller) in my neighborhood and they said they wouldn't sell the phone without a data plan. i thought that was weird so i called tmobile customer service and they told me that the phone would not work at all unless i had a 30$ data plan. i don't really want a data plan because i planned on using wifi(available in most places i will be using the phone) for internet access instead. so my question is, can i buy an unlocked galaxy s and use it on t-mobile(us) without a data plan? will any problems arise from me going this route(updates, servicing, etc). thanks</content>
