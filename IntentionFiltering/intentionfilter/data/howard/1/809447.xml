		<content>hello hofo members! i am looking to buy a nexus one in 10/10 condition. i will not take any phones that have even a scuff on it. - please keep that in mind. i prefer the rogers/att 3g bands but i will take a t-mo if the price is right. i am located in canada so i would prefer to buy from a canadian or someone who can mark it as a gift so i avoid those nasty customs. the phone must have it's original box. please contact me via e-mail (look below) or pm. i guarantee a fast response to either one. i prefer if you e-mail me. e-mail: kushgandhis at gmail dot com thank for your taking the time to look at my ad</content>
