		<content>hi, earlier i owned a a95 model and loved the features like flip  rotate lcd and quick shooting mode selection. (14 modes by the rotating knob). now i am looking for a simple and small digital camera with above features added to that i prefer to have 2 aa batteries, light weight, easy to use and suitable for both outdoor and indoor shootings. any suggestion is highly appreciated. thanks!</content>
