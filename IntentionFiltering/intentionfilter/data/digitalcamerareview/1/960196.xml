		<content>i am considering buying a cannon power shot sx200is. when i look at the various retail listings and prices i can find nothing that tells me what comes with the camera (if anything) for the sale price. i think that it would come with a fairly small memory card and that i probably want to upgrade; but what about the usb cable and pc install software? also, will this camera run off regualr batteries? also, does anyone know if this camera has a quick responce once the picture button is hit? lasteve</content>
