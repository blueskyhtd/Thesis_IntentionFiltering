		<content>hello everyone, i am looking for a good quality compact for my friend.... now he does not want the g11 series because it "does not look sexy" so i have been looking around and found the canon s95 i tried it out but the flash seems very weak... is it possible to adjust the power of the flash on this camera like the g series? i couldn't really play around in that detail at the time so i couldn't see for myself... thanks</content>
