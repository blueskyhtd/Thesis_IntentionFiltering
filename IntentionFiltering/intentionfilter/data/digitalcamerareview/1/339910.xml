		<content>recently got this great camera but was told it didn't have another power source other than batteries. just read in the manual that there is a power adapter ca-ps700. since i take many of my wildlife pics from inside through a window, a plug in would be great - if it's long enough or can handle an extension cord. i read reviews and it seems like this is what i need, although some reviewers (and one description referred to it as a charger.) anyone have one and/or know about how long it is? thanks!! beth</content>
