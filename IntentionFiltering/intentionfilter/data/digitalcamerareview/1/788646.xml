		<content>hi everyone. i'm new here and this is my first post. i just received my new canon 40d today. i bought the body and lens separately based on info i read on this site. i'm an artist and i paint in both watercolor and oil. i update my website on a daily basis by taking photos of my paintings in progress. up til now i used my olympus 2.1 c-2020 z (my first digital camera after 25 years of using a pentax spotmatic i bought in the military) to photo my paintings. when my oil painting is on it's easel and very wet, all i had to do with the olympus was to stand 5 feet away and shoot the image. i just went into my studio and tried to take a photo of a 4'x4' canvas and i can't back up far enough to get the entire canvas in the picture. can't take it outdoors as it is too wet to handle and i don't want foreign objects sticking to it. so, i've got a real nice lens that will work with most of my other needs, but doesn't work so well in a confined space. what other lens should i look at that is in the same quality level as my 50mm that will allow me to shoot a canvas 4' wide from 5-6 feet away? thanks scott</content>
