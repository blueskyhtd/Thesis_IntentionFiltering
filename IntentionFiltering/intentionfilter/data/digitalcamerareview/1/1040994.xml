		<content>hey there, i have a big problem. i destroyed my camera completely it was one of those slim digital cameras and now i am in desperate need of a new one, but i decided to buy a bigger, more professional one for my traveling to paris. i found several canon's on the internet but i just can't decide which one i should buy, above all, because i do not have the slightest clue which camera is good and which one simply is not. there are several single lens reflex canon eos cameras, but i do not know, because i am an absolute technical failure.</content>
