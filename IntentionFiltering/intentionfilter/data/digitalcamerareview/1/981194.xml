		<content>hi everyone ^^, i have been lurking in these forums for quite sometime ^^. but now i have a question. i want to get a canon ps camera, and i am unsure on which one to get. i looked at the digitalcamerareview's for both the sd880 and sd960, and they are pretty comprehensive. but i want an opinion from someone who has test or used both camera's please ^^. the reviews at amazon.com are also mixed on the sd960is as some like, while other abhor it due to over saturation of the colors.</content>
