		<content>hi guys, a few weeks back i posted about possibly replacing my 17-85mm canon lens, but i've decided to keep it after all. i've really been looking closely at the canon 50mm f/1.4 lens, which seems to have very positive reviews. anyone have first-hand experiences or comments about this lens? it is about $399 where i get it here in vancouver, canada!</content>
