		<content>hello all! i'm chattphotos or silent shadows in the studio. i shoot pentax k-7, but we live in a canon/nikon world. so i got bold and bought a canon 30d from a friend that upgraded to the 50d mk2. i shoot alot of nature, people, pets, and night photography. in your opinion/experience with canon, is this a good buy? if it is a good buy, what lenses would you recommend for it?</content>
