		<content>ok, basically the difference in features is 8mp vs 7mp, and 6x vs 4x. i would like to know (from someone who has had experience with both cameras): comparatively, which has 1 - better overall (indoor/outdoor) picture quality 2 - better battery performance 3 - faster (shutter lag/shot to shot/flash recycle) operation 4 - less red-eye problems thank you!</content>
