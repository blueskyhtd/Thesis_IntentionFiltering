		<content>i'm having a hard time deciding which canon is right for me. i would love an slr but simply cannot afford it but would like the next best thing. i have kids so i would like a movie mode camera and something that takes fast, clear pictures. i have it narrowed between 3 models: the canon sx210is, canon g11, and canon sx20 is. i really like the flip lcd screens and the hd movie mode but i don't want that to outweigh the fact i want clean crisp pictures! any suggestions?</content>
