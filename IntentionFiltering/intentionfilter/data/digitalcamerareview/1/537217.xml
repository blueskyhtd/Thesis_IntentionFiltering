		<content>newbie here so thanks in advance for help with my question. i just picked up a sd780is for $179, but noticed they just came out with the sd940is, the difference appears to be 4x optical zoom vs. 3x and a larger display 2.5 vs 2.7 inch, elimination of the viewfinder and a slightly different lens. so the cheapest i can find the sd940is for is about $275 - do you all think it is worth the difference? i am looking for a high quality small point and shoot camera. thanks in advance for your help!</content>
