		<content>hi everyone i am trying to decide which of the canon powershot models to buy, either the a710 or a720. the only thing i am not sure of is whether it is possible to use the zoom lens feature in movie mode on the a720is, as i know you can on the a710? does anyone know the answer to this query for me? thanks to all who respond. brian</content>
