		<content>hello, i have a canon rebel xs and i'm currently looking into getting a tripod and eventually looking into buying a lens. i wanted someone's opinion on what would be the best. lens- i do a lot of outdoor and a little indoor. i read the lens buyers guide and wasn't sure which one exactly i should lean towards more. tripod- i read about a brand called velbon. i seen on another forum that they had highly recommended it. i would like other's opinion on what they think that would be best.</content>
