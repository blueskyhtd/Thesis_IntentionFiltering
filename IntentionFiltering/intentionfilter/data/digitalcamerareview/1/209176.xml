		<content>hi, i have a canon sd1000 and i recently lost my battery and charger. i was looking to replace them both with factory canon products, however i was curious if anyone has purchased the "no-name" products and are pleased with them. i don't mind buying the canon brand however i am looking to save as much money as possible. if there are some recommendations of where to buy from it would be greatly appreciated. thank you. mike</content>
