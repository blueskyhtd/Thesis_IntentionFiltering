		<content>i'm planning to get the canon sd800is and have a question about how durable digital cameras are. i plan to use the camera for family photos and vacations, but occasionally will take it with me when i ride my dirt bike. it will be kept inside a backpack with padding around it. will the bouncing around that takes place riding an offroad motorcycle cause any problems with a digital camera?</content>
