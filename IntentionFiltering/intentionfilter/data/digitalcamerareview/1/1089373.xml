		<content>i'm about to buy a new camera and i was thinking about that nice sx130, it is compact, aa batteries and nice zoom, mean while, i fell in love with the upcoming sx30. everything tells me to buy the cheap, small and aa batteries operated cam and not to the buy a more expensive bulky sx30, but com'on, 35x zoom ??? that's amazing. at some sites, i found sample images of sx130 superior than that of sx30!! could this be the case? i know sx30 is a pre-release, but anyone compared sx130 with sx20 (closest relative) ??</content>
