		<content>i'm looking at getting a new camera and came across these two, the canon ixus 860 (powershot sd870) and the ixus 870 (powershot sd880) (why can't they keep the same numbering system?). when i googled them the following links to the canon australia website came up. http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus860is.aspx http://www.canon.com.au/products/cam...ixus870is.aspx the main camera menu on the canon website doesn't show these cameras, however, and i can't find many places that sell them (only online stores). are these discontinued models in australia as it appears that they are still being sold overseas. thanks</content>
