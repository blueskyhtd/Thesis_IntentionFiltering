		<content>hello, i am thinking to get a canon rebel xsi (aka 450d). is this a good camera for taking fast moving pictures? my girl does gymnastic. when using my regular point and shoot camera, i rarely have a picture that is no blurred. based on what i have read so far, i think canon might able to meet my requirement. but i still want to hear your advice. also, i am looking for the cheapest (and trustworthy) place to get one in canada or us. i am thinking to get the kit with two lens. your comments are welcome! tia dw</content>
