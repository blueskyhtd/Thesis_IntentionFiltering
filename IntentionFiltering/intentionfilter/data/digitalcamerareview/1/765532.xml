		<content>okay so i have a sd200 and im going to upgrade bc my screen is cracked. i dont know which camera i should get. which is better? i assumed that the higher numbers were better, more recent versions, but the numbering here threw me off. i also noticed that the sd1000 is cheaper so im leaning towards it. is there a big difference between the cameras?</content>
