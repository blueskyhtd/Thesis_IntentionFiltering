		<content>hi! :0) i have been playing around with the cam after reading understanding exposure, after troubleshooting everything recc, i think i may need a new lens? i have a canon s5 is. i love taking close up pics of my babies. you know, pics where their sweet chubby face fills the entire frame? i usually try to do this when they are about 1-2 feet from me. i am getting blur. i am pretty sure i am too close to them, but if i back up, the pic is not as close as i want it. is there a lens that i can order that will help me with this? second, i love taking pics of my boys playing. i am usually pretty far away, and i zoom in. when i try to zoom in to get a closer pic, their faces are soft. can a diff lens help me with this? or...maybe can someone give me a rundown of what each of the diff lenses do?</content>
