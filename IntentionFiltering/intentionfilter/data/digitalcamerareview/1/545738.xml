		<content>a review of the sd870is from dpreview notes: "the sd870 takes around 1.1 seconds to process and save a ~4.0mb 8mp/super fine jpeg (exact size depends on the complexity of the image being shot); which is by no means tardy. given this relatively fast performance, it makes sense to use a fast card to prevent adding a bottleneck to the process." sandisk's ultra 2 (a class 4 card) writes 9mb/sec while the extreme 3 (class 6) writes at 20mb/sec it seems like either way both these cards can outpace the camera. what will i be missing if i buy the cheaper ultra 2? how will the movie mode be affected?</content>
