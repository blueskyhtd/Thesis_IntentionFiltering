		<content>ok, so i was very much set on getting that a710is. it's just that i was waiting for my creditcard's award points to rack up enough (i just need to wait for it to be updated as i finally do have enough points to order 3x$100 gift cards for jr). and in the meanwhile, this thing called a570is comes out with the new digic iii processor. currently from jr a710 goes for $264.88 and a570 goes for $279.99 (pre-order). i don't really need that huge 6x zoom (it may come in handy like... once or twice a year). i would think these two would be similar in picture quality. oh and i also want to know if there may be some difference in the tft screens also (low temp vs amorphous?) finally, though i could be horribly wrong, the newer processor might give a570 a bit more battery, either or both because it just might be more efficient and/or since it processes stuff faster, less time wasted on sucking up the juice. any suggestions?</content>
