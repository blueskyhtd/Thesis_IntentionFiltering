		<content>hi all i have an old canon eos500n film slr camera with ef 28-80mm usm lens. i am now interested in buying a dslr and was looking at canon eos1000d or canon eos450d. i understand that both eos1000d and eos450d can take ef and ef-s lenses. however, what i wanted to know was that by using the ef 28-80mm usm lens, will i lose any functionality? also, is it important / better to get an is lens? many thanks for your answers.</content>
