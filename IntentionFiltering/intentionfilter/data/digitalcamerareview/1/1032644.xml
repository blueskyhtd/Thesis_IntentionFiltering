		<content>http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...74catid=20220 + aa batteries + 4x zoom + 8 mp + cheaper + image stabilization http://www.bestbuy.ca/catalog/prodde...12catid=22474 + 3" lcd screen + faster in shooting pics + better movie mode + ultra-compact i know it's weird to compare, especially since sd750 is an ultracompact. but i'm torn between these two. this is gonna be mainly for family events and stuff. i think the dealbreaker will be which one takes better pictures. i can't find any comparison on the net, so tips?</content>
