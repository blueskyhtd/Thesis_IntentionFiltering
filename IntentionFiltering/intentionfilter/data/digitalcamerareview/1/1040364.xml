		<content>hi, i plan on buying a macro flash (not light) for my canon s2 is. there digital ones are either really expensive or are leds, which i don't want. here's my plan, tell me if it'll work: - 35mm camera ring flash with 52mm adapter: link - wireless optical slave flash trigger with sync socket: link - canon s2/s3/s5 52mm adapter from lensmate - raynox dcr-250 super macro filter from lensmate my questions... 1) the macro flash doesn't have controllable power and the raynox dcr-250 is restricted to a working distance of 4" - 4 5/8". how is it possible to take good macro pictures if the flash isn't controllable and i can't control the distance??? 2) will this trigger be compatible with the macro flash via the sync socket even if i don't have anything mounted to the hot shoe of the trigger? 3) will this trigger be compatible with my s2 is? in which mode can i disable the pre flash? thank you. regards, yan</content>
