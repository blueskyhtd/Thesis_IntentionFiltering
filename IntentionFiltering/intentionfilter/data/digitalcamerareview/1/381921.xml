		<content>i have a 2 year old, out of warranty, canon sd1000. it needs to be repaired. the cost is $100. in addition, i have lost the battery charger. that will cost me extra as well to replace. should i repair the camera or replace it? i would be out $100 plus the cost of replacing the battery charger. i looked at the sd1200is. i assume that is the current generation release of the sd1000 line. it is available for about $165 (and that includes a battery charger!). thanks.</content>
