		<content>my daughter has a powershot g11 and we were thinking of getting her a protective cover for it, perhaps a filter or two. it bothers my husband that the lens is so exposed. (our daughter isn't the most conscientious, even with expensive items. sigh.) i was looking at an opteka on amazon (3 for $25) . would this work as indicated or would i need extra equipment. (i am not sure i would need to get an adapter tube, for instance.) feedback anyone. thanks</content>
