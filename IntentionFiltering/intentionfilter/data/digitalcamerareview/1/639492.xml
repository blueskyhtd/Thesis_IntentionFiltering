		<content>i just was about to order a canon sx10 si when the salesperson asked if i wanted the us or eruopean version. i asked the difference and he said the instruction book. he also said the difference in cost is $350+ for us and $264 for the eruopean. it sounds fishy to me and can't find anything on google. anyone have information on us vs european versions?? toms</content>
