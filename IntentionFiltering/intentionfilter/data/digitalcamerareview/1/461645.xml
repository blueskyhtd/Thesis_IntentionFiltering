		<content>hi folks, i guess there is none? what does this mean? so some type of memory card has to be bought before using this camera? how many pics can i hold on any particular size card? what type to buy for amatuer type photos? as you can tell i am new to this so bear with me. will this canera allow me to download photos w/o a 2.0 usb port? i have an older laptop with windows xp but the older usb port? is this an ok camera for vacation type photos? thanks paul</content>
