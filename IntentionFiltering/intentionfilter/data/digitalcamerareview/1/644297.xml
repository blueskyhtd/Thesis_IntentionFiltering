		<content>while i wait to buy a dslr i'm getting anxious and considering the a590is as an upgrade from my old a85. one key difference is the a85 takes 4 aa batteries and the a590is takes only 2 aa's. should i assume then that the a590is will get 1/2 the battery life when compared to the a85? maybe a trivial question but if you don't know, ask; right?</content>
