		<content>since the sd700 is kind of a rarity to find in stores nowadays, i did find it somewhere for about $300 (reputable dealer, currently on order not in stock), tax and shipping included, new. i don't know if i should jump on this or wait on it since prices, opposed to what many have said, have actually gone up over the past two months or so on these models. i also can try to get the sd800 for about $340 or so from the current office depot 20#37; off all non-dslr canon cameras $199 and up if a price match is accepted, but that may be hard since it's not currently in stock and only goes until 1/27. any expert advice on the pricing changes that i should expect? or maybe any awesome upcoming dell camera coupons to be expected? not sure how often dell does it.</content>
