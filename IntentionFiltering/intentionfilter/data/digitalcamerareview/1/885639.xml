		<content>hi i'm looking to buy a new canon lense for sports photography (mostly outside moving shots like athletics). i'd like a zoom capacity for distance and i'm thinking 70-200mm. i'm not sure whether to go image stabilizing or f/2.8 as both in one lense is a little too expensive for me at the moment. someone suggested 70-200 f/4 l would be good. does anyone have any advice? i have a 24-70mm f/2.8l which i love at the moment.</content>
