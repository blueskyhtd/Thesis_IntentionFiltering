		<content>i'm in the market for a camera and i have my eyes set on a a570 is. and while shopping around i came across this deal at walmart. is it a good deal? i really do need a new printer, i have both a separate printer/scanner taking up space on my desk, so i'm considering getting this to replace the two. the photo paper is icing on the cake too.</content>
