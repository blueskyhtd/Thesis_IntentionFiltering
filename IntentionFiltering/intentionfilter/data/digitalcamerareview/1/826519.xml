		<content>after reading review after review i went and held the canon 50d with a 28-135mm lens. i must say i like the feel of it. very well built i feel. i think i am going to take the plunge and buy one, i just am not sure what the best len would be for it. i like to shoot outdoor photography- sporting events- any advice on lenses would be great. thanks in advance, mike o.</content>
