		<content>ladies and gentlemen i am sort of a "neanderthal" of digital photography and would like to purchase a top of the line digital camera without venturing into the slr world. i currently own a minolta dimage which is dawning away. my choice narrows down to the canon powershot g9 and the s5 is. both have qualities i like and others i dislike. i like the g9 but dislike the use of non aa type batteries. i like the s5 is but it does not have raw (not fundamental). are they bulky cameras? with three kids i do not want slr type material, i have enough to carry around as things stand. any helps, tips, suggestions... are more than welcome. thank you and regards bert</content>
