		<content>visiting back with a question after a long time... i'm on an eos 400d - and at some point will want to make a leap (direct leap bypassing the xxd series) - i hope for summer 2010 at the latest (maybe christmas, spring??). so, 2 questions: 1) what is the typical time for a 5d mk ii to be delivered if orderd by a camera shop - i have seen comments that canon does not seem to produce them quick enough and they are backordered? (just a typical value) 2) any news on a mk iii version of the 5d? the internet doesn't seem to helpful in this respect at the moment. (i'd prefer it to a mk iii as it would have to last a long time - so a newer model would be better in this respect) thanks for any replies (and there is still plenty of time)</content>
