		<content>i have been reading reviews about the canon powershot sd700, and there seem to be quite a few complaints about the "red eye" condition. any suggestions? i am pretty much of a camera novice, so i want a camera that is easy to use but with some nice features that i can use as i become more knowledgeable.</content>
