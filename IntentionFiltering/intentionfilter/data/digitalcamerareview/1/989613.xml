		<content>hi everyone, i currently have a canon s1 is and i'm considering upgrading to a canon s5 is. can anyone tell me what has been improved on the s5 is? what features are different or better? i have had some issues with focusing with the s1 is, so i am wondering if that is better. is it easier to use the manual focus on the s5 is? i can't really figure that out. thanks!</content>
