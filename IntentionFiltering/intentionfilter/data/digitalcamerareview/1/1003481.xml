		<content>i got a canon s500 back around 4/05 and am trying to decide if i should upgrade soon... my main complaints are blurry images without flash in indoor lighting. the image quality when i can get a sharp shot is fine, no complaints with that really, but the frequent blurry images are what gets me. how do the newer cameras compare?</content>
