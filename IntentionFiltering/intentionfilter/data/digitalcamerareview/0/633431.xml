		<content>hello all, my canon powershot sx130 is has a really poor battery life, i am using camera rechargeables but it only last for about 30 minutes, 5 when i go into video shooting, i've tried using long life batteries but the same thing happens, even though all the batteries i used were fully charged and worked perfectly when but into my mouse, is this a problem with my camera, or should i install something on my computer? also, the batteries included with the camera are supposed to last 7 hours (according to the manual), but the lasted the same time as my other batteries.</content>
