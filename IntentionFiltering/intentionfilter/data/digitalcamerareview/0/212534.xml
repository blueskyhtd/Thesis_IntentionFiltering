		<content>hello- i'm new here, and i hope this won't seem like an irrelevant question. i just bought another canon camera-the sx130is. i think i like it pretty well. my other canon , my point and shoot is a power shot a720is. i have used it steadily for at least 2 years, and i think i have worn it out. probably made 20-25,000 shots with it. i carry it in my pocket constantly. the main fault is that the lcd screen window is loaded with trash. dust, pieces of grass, etc. once i actually saw a small living spider walking around inside there. don't know what happened to him! so i want to take better care of my new toy, and thought a press-on/non-click type of lens cap might be available to fit it. i looked at canon site and did not see anything applicable unless some lens caps might just coincidentally fit. the actual measurement seems to be between 2 5/16 and 2 11/32 inches. something near 59-60 mm? if anyone can help out with this, i will be greatful. thanks, henry</content>
