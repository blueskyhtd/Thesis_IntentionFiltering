		<content>i bought a canon rebel xt a few months ago. i enjoy using the camera...i was wondering if anybody knew if there is a black and white mode? i read in the manuel that there was that option under the menu...but when i go through my camera options, it doesn't appear. is there something additional that i need to buy? thanks for any input.</content>
