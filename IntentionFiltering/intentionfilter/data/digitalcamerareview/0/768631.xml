		<content>i've got an ixus 980is, only 1/2 year old. one day, i realize that the function/set button is jammed. tried pressing hard but still stuck, also tried using a sharp thin object to try and lift the button up but still couldn't. sent to canon support. repair cost is $64usd. just wanna hear from you guys whether it's worth repairing the button. the camera is still is still functioning well but the only reason why i need the button is to set certain options, features and to delete photos.</content>
