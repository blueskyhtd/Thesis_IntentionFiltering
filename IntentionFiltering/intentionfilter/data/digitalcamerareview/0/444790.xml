		<content>i'm a newbie and i have the s3is digital camera. when recording a video the camera just suddenly stops recording after about 4-5 minutes for no reason. it has done this with a 2,4, and 8 gb sd memory card. the batteries are fresh and the memory card is formatted. the settings are re-set to the factory default settings. does anyone have a solution to this problem. the manual states that it should at least record up to one hour. please help!</content>
