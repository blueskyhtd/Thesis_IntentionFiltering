		<content>i purchased the canon s2is in 08/05 and think it takes great pictures. i am having a problem finding a good setting for indoor sports pictures though (the pictures are always blurry). i don't believe there's a "sports" setting. can anyone tell me what settings would take the best indoor sports photos?</content>
