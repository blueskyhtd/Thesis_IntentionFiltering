		<content>i'm a new slr user - purchased my s2 is a couple of years ago and have spotty results (am sure it is user error not the camera ..). many pics are blurry - camera doesn't seem to react to slight movements with subjects. any tips on what settings i should check/alter would be appreciated! i'm almost at the point to going back to a point and shoot model as i think i'm over my head with this slr</content>
