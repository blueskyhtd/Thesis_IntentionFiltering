		<content>i have been using a canon sd 500 elph since march. suddenly, the anti-glare coating that gives the lcd screen a purplish tint, is coming off. i am very gentle with the screen and it was never scratched. i keep it in a soft case at all times. it is coming-off in thin areas rather than in large areas. canon wants me to send it in for repairs but i have no back-up camera in the meantime so i can not return it. i don't know why they spray a coating on it anyway. my eyeglasses likewise were sprayed with an anti-glare coating and also came off but that took 5 years!</content>
