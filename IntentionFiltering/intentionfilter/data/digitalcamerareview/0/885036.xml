		<content>i took my canon sd1200 is on a snorkel trip (in an underwater case) and when the glare was bright, the lcd screen did not display the scene below. since i was holding the camera pointing mostly down, the screen would have been receiving the sun's light directly. if i tilted the camera a bit, the scene would appear. other times, nothing would work. and at sunset, this was not a problem. i want to know why this happens and if i can set any controls to avoid losing the picture i'm about to take. this is very frustrating when i have only seconds to 'shoot' an eagle ray or octopus and don't know where to aim the camera.</content>
