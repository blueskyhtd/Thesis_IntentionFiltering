		<content>i am new at this but i do need help. a month ago i bought sx10is. upgrading i thought from a s2is, but it is not working for me. i can not get macro - super macro to work - either it is focused but washed out too light or it is not focused but right colours - tried a lot of thing but not working- i am about to give up and go back to my old camera</content>
