		<content>am i the only 1 was this problem? i cannot see the lcd screen out of doors. i have tried brightening the screen and even using my hand to block the sunlight, but to no avail. most of my photos are either off-center or are ruined. how do you guys use the screen? indoors or on cloudy days, there's no problem. i am tired of getting home and having to delete most of my snapshots.</content>
