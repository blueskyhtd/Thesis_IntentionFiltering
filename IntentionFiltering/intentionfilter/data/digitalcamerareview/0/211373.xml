		<content>enjoy shooting with digital, knowing pictures come out verses film, but don't know much about the technical stuff behind the camera. does a larger card (1gig or 2 gig) make a camera faster? would that help my current camera, a nikon coolpix 4300 which currently i miss my daughters sports (volleyball and soccer) action shots because it is sooooooo slow. i only use a 128 mb card in it. if so, does it make it faster taking pictures (with shutter lag) or just time between shots, going into sleep mode, etc. i do notice that the more pictures i have on the card the slower it gets. thanks!!!!!</content>
