		<content>i am having a hard time finding the a620 from a reputable retailer and i was told that it has been discontinued. newegg and buy.com both list it as on back order. is there a good reason canon stopped making it, especially since the a700 is not a perfect replacement (i.e. no articulating lcd)?</content>
