		<content>hi, i have a new canon sx 30 is and i love it--especially the photo quality. i am just learning the technicalities of it, but i'm having a problem. when i use the zoom to frame pictures (especially using the zoom to take a close up from a distance), the camera often (but not always) moves out from the zoom level i have chosen and selects a much broader zoom length (i.e. zooms out). i don't know whether this is something i am doing wrong, a setting i can change, or something wrong with the camera. i would much prefer to be able to tell the camera how closely i want to take the picture, rather than having the camera "tell me." any thoughts from someone experienced with this camera? thanks.</content>
