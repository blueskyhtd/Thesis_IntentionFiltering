		<content>i got a d50 for christmas and i love the camera -except one thing: i cant figure out how to turn the lcd on or off. shouldnt the lcd turn on when you depress the shutter half way? there has to be a way to have the lcd screen on while you're shooting. ive poured over the manual and cant seem to find the answer. help!</content>
