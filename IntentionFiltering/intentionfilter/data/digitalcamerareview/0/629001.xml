		<content>i've got a sx100, 1yr 9m old, that simply won't go on. no damage, no liquid, no nothing -- one day it worked, took a photo, next day wouldn't go on. only thing that happened in between was i took out the memory card to download the photo i took; standard procedure, no different than any other time i did it. batteries have been changed, terminals have been cleaned, nothing seems broken. any ideas? thanks.</content>
