		<content>i bought my canon powershot sd1200is in may '09. i purchased an ativa 4gb memory card that was on sale at the same time to use with the camera. my pictures have always looked overexposed (even when i am not pointing the camera at a light source). i often have to use photoshop to adjust the contrast and color, so that the pictures look decent. is there a function that i need to adjust on the camera to correct this problem? could the cheap memory card be the problem? did i just get a faulty camera? any advice would be greatly appreciated.</content>
