		<content>i have a canon camcorder (ivis hf r10). i have no problem taking videos with it but i am really disappointed at how the pictures come out using this camera. especially when the room is dark. the camera has no flash. i of course change the mode so that it takes brighter pictures in the dark but the photo looks bad. please help!</content>
