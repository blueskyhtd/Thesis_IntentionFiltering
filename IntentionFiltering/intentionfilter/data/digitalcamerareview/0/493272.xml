		<content>is it just me, or do the colors look flat? i've been pretty happy with my new 870is but after uploading the images to my comp for the first time i was a little disappointed. granted they've been indoor shots (mostly florescent lighting though), but i was hoping for something a little punchier. i now started shooting everything with vivid coloring and i hope that will work, but if you guys have any other suggestions i'd really appreciate it.</content>
