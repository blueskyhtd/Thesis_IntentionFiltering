		<content>i have a canon rebel xt for about a year now. i love using it, but for some reason the lighting on the pictures isn't as good as it used to be. i use it on automatic settings most of the time, but the lighting sucks indoor during the day and night. does anyone have the same problem? or did i change something on the camera accidentally? any input would be helpful!!! thanks</content>
