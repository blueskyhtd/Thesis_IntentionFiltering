		<content>i have had this camera for about a year now and it worked great for several months. however, the last 4 months with this camera has been a nightmare because i can no longer focus consistently. when i first purchased the camera i am almost positive i could focus on an object at any distance. obviously if an object was far away i could only zoom to a certain point, but the camera would zoom as close as it could and take the picture. now if i try to zoom in on an object at a distance the camera will not focus enough to take the picture in auto mode. i can manually take the picture, but the picture is fuzzy. for instance, if i am across a room and try to zoom in on my son on the other side the camera will not focus and take the picture.</content>
