		<content>now that the camera has seen some vacation time and travel i have comments. the software is great compared to what i've had come with other cameras. my prints have come out great (up to 8x10 prints) and i love its compact size and battery life saving features (turn off lcd, viewfinder, turn off camera automatically after certain amount of time) build quality seems excellent as well. i like the usb 2.0 and direct print features (all new to me) complaints: shots with flash have a rather long refresh rate (between shots) the lcd while big enough could have a better resolution its pretty fuzzy.</content>
