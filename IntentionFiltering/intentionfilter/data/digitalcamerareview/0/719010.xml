		<content>i broke the screen of my powershot sx 110 is camera and sent it for repair to a specialized lab. i received back the camera with a working screen but the surface is not as pristine as i expected (several scratches). can anyone tell me if the screen has a protective plastic layer that may have not been changed, or whether the lab installed a used screen (while i paid for anew one?) many thanks</content>
