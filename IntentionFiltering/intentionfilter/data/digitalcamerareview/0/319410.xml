		<content>my director used the canon again for the next video that we shot. this time we added a moving dolly and other stands to hold and maneuver the camera so that the angles would be more interesting. the lens he used was a canon 16-35mm f2.8l. i rented it from samy's for about $35. i need feedback, please please note that there's rapping in the song youtube - #x202a;damozel - "take a picture" the remix#x202c;rlm;</content>
