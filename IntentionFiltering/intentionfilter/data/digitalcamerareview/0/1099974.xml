		<content>hi! yesterday, i bought a canon powershot sx 20 is, and, of course, i am still learning all its possibilities. in the manual they don't mention about using lithium non-rechargeable batteries. and i tried it anyway, and the camera doesn't even want to work with these (yes, they are new!). i don't uderstand why this happens: 4 aa batteries rated at 6 volts total should work, no? (and last a long longer). pls explain to me. ah: another question i am pretty used to work using tv (shutter-priority). but on my new canon, when the light is too low, shutter speed changes by itself on this mode, going to a much slower speed. is this normal on this model? i find it strange, because this feature should be only on full auto or p setting. thx very much!</content>
