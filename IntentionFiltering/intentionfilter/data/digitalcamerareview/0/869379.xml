		<content>hi everyone - i seem to be missing a ton of shots because i go to take the pic and my camera won't shoot - then i have to wait a few secs, hold down the shutter slightly until frame locks in, then i can take the shot (for canon users - i hold down until i hear the beeping "lock in" noise and then can take the shot). what is going on with it?!</content>
