		<content>i had a canon g10 and now i have a g12 power shot. with both cameras i have the same problem, using the internal flash, in low light conditions peoples faces are washed out, definitions are flat even at 8ft. i ma using auto settings and 4:3x10m size pictures. am i asking for too much, or having the wrong settings? external speedlite 270ex or-so solved the problem.</content>
