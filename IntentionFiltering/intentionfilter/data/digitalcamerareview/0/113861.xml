		<content>any ideas on cleaning your camera? i've noticed dark areas on pictures that have to be dust somewhere in my camera. i clean my lenses all the time so i don't think the dust is there. if there is a thread pertaining to this topic i'm sorry, please direct me to it. if not, i'd love some ideas before i dive in with a lens cloth wiping stuff that should not be wiped. thanks, andrew</content>
