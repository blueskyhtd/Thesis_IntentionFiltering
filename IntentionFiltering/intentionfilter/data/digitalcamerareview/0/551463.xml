		<content>i just got the sx130 a couple days ago after reading many positive reviews. i have to say i'm dissapointed in the picture quality when taking pics of my kids. their skin tone looks weird and the shutter speed tends to go slow. any suggestions. i upgraded to this from a 2004 fuji that had 6mp. i wanted something that could shoot great pics indoors and outdoors and go from picture to picture fast. also the image stabilization isn't as impressive as i would have thought. are their settings i might need to change? any advice?</content>
