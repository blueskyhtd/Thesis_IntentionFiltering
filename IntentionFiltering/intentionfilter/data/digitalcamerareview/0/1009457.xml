		<content>just bought my third canon powershot, an sd1400is. my first digital camera was a 500s back in '03, then went to an sd780, and now my 1400. i love the updated features, especially the fact it will go into macro mode automatically if you are too close to an object. i just got it, and haven't messed around with the manual settings, but i'm sure i'll be able to fine tune it and get some better pictures. anyway, here is a picture of our fire last night. i typically overload our fireplace....i'm a bit of a pyro. but hey...it made for a great photo opportunity. this was one hot fire!</content>
