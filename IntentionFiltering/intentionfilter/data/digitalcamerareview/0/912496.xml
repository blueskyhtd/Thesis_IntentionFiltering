		<content>wearing a good pair of polarized sunglasses while playing around with our new sx200is at the local dog park, i thought i had a problem with the display. viewed in the "landscape" orientation, the display was great. viewed in the "portrait" orientation, my display went dark. once i took off the polarizing glasses, everything was fine. obviously. the problem was the glasses...i wonder if the display is polarized itself? dave</content>
