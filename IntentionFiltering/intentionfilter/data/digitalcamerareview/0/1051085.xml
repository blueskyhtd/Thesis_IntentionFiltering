		<content>hi all, i just bought a canon g9, nice camera. i have just one question, is it possible to set the camera to normal usb-mode? i mean so i can take the pictures off the camera without using an additional software interface. i know i can take the memory card out of the camera and put it into a cardreader, but i'd rather just plug the usb cable into the camera and then 'drag and drop' the photos to my harddisk using explorer. i cannot find a way how to do this in the manual. thanks for the help, heinzvoerbakje</content>
