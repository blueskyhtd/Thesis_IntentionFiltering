		<content>hi everyone, i am wondering if anyone has had this problem. the first two times i charged the batteries, the battery life was great. they lasted a long time. however, since the third time, the batteries don't even last 5 minutes before my camera flashes the low battery alert. i store the two batteries not in use (they came in a set of 4) in a drawer in my desk, so it satisfies the "dark, cool, and dry" storage place that the instructions recommend. i also only recharge the batteries when my camera indicated low battery (but the batteries were not totally dead). is it possible that this is a temporary problem or have the batteries already lost their charge capacity permanently? thanks</content>
