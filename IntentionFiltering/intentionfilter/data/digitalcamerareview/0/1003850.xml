		<content>if someone can point me to where this is in the camera, i would be most grateful. i can't find it for the life of me. the canon website says the sx100 is has this as part of my colors mode, but i don't see it anywhere. i bought this camera with the expectation that i could take a photo and turn it all black and white except for one portion with this feature. here's the link from the canon website. http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/co...15672id=14327</content>
