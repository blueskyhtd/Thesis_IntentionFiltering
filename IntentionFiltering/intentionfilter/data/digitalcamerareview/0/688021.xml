		<content>i have tried to change settings and no matter what i do when i open an image in paint shop pro i can only get 180 dpi in the original image. is there a way to get at least 300 dpi off the camera? i bought this camera because i am an artist and am trying to get high res photos of my paintings. i have been fighting with this for a long time and would really appreciate some advice. thanks! lynne</content>
