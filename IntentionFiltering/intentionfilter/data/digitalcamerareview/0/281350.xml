		<content>hey y'all! i ended up buying the canon elph 300 hs last week and love it! but the one thing i don't love is the material on the outside. it's rough and feels like sandpaper. well, i can get over that, but it's already scratched up quite a bit...with fingernail polish that's scratched off from people exchanging hands, etc. is there any safe way to clean it or maybe something i can put on it to protect it from stuff like that and scratches. thanks in adavnced!</content>
