		<content>i bought a canon sx110 a couple of weeks ago and i noticed that the first bunch of pictures i took had a .jpg file size of between 1.8mb to 2.5mb ..... and then after i fiddles with things a bit the file sizes are much larger now, bgetting up over 5mb. is this normal? the sizes seem kinda large to me. taking a variety of color and bw fotos with different zooms. will that make a difference in file size? any other settings that i may have misconfigured? thanks in advance for the advice! hugh</content>
