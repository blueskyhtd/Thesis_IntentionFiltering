		<content>i just sold my d80 and eagerly awaiting to switch back to canon. i was originally going to get the 40d but the xsi just welded its ugly head. the main thing i want is live preview (here are some great demonstration videos: http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...noneos450d.php). i also do a lot of studio stuff where i can hook up the camera to comp or laptop and it would be amazing if i could frame things on my 17" laptop screen or even my tablet. i know the 40d has this feature, anyone know if the xsi will? the xsi has pretty damn close to everything i wanted to upgrade to from the d80. the main thing is the fps is still stuck at 3fps, but thats about the same as the d80, so i don't really lose anything.</content>
