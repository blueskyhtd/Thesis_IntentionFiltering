		<content>hi. recently my pics have been a little blurry and i can't seem to fix this problem. i take mostly bird and animal shots using the auto focus setting. i work at the zoo and we've had two giraffe births in the past two weeks! so, i really want to get some pics but know i should study the manual further but just wanted to throw out a quick "help please." thanks so much in advance. beth</content>
