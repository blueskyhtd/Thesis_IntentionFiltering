		<content>after going through multiple user evaluations, the canon eos 40d dslr passed with flying colors. here is the low down on the canon eos 40d: the good: generally superior shooting speed among dslrs; first-rate photo quality. the bad: large spot size for spot meter; relatively sluggish low-light focus. the bottom line: great photo quality and excellent continuous-shooting performance are just two of the canon eos 40d's many attractive features. this would be a good choice for professional photographers to consider. hope this helps!</content>
