		<content>my camera is several years old but still takes great photos. however, the only way to take a picture now is using the optical viewfinder as the view screen will not show a picture being taken, but will allow me to view a picture that has already been taken. any ideas? i am wondering if i somehow changed a setting that i can correct, or is my camera just breaking? thanks!</content>
