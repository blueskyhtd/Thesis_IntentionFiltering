		<content>hi, ive had canon powershot sx20 is for nearly six months. im quite happy with it. but today i noticed that some pictures show a notable red dot in the exact same place. depending on light or sth else, the red dot is more visible. on other pictures i cant find it. on some i can. the place never changes. so, id like to know if that is the so-called matrix fault? a warranty job? or its just something that i shouldnt care about?</content>
