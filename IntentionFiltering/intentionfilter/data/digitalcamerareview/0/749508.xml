		<content>i have just purchased this camera and it states a 12 meg picture? when the pictures are taken and viewed, the largest pixel may only be around 3 meg? all of the settings are correct for a 4000x3000 and fine (shoot high quality images). as an example, when viewing properties of a picture on the camera, the picture indicates "12m 4000x3000" but show 1.88 mb? why doesn't it take a 12 mb picture? thanks for anyone's help in advance. rick</content>
