		<content>i just bought an sd1200 is (my wife wanted an ultra compact), and i find the image quality to be horrendous. printing out 4x6s with minimal cropping produces extreme pixelation. i previously used the canon a620 (7.1mp) and loved the quality of the images, so i trusted moving to the sd1200. anyone have any ideas why the images are so poor? the reviews all throughout the web rate this a a great camera and one that produces top images. i am not seeing it. i do have the camera set to auto, and the file format to large (full 10mp file). please help!</content>
