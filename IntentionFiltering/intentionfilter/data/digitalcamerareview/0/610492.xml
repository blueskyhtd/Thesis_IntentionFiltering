		<content>hello, i have had my first digital camera (sd750) for about two weeks now and have read the manuals cover to cover numerous times and done lots of experimenting. i figured out that i don't have a lag taking the shot if i hold down my shutter to focus ... then compose  shoot. but it still takes what seems like forever to take my next shot because the picture i have just take displays on the lcd screen forever! what setting have i overlooked that can be changed to shorten and/or eliminate the display of the photo just taken? thank in advance.</content>
