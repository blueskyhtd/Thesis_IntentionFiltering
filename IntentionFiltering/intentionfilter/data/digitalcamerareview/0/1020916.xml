		<content>as i keep a pretty close eye on camera news, i keep seeing the "coverage" of a canon digital slr / phone rumor on other camera sites. the best part about it is that, as far as i can tell, the "news" started at bbspot - a known satire site. in fact, their html title includes: "satire for smart people; the truth for you". the irony is amazing. for the original humor from bbspot: http://www.bbspot.com/news/2006/01/c...ne-camera.html</content>
