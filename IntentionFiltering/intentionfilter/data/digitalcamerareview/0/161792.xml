		<content>1. there is a green focus box in auto mode, i can't control what it focuses on.. does that mean if it focuses on something to the right, it won't focus on what i'm point at in the center? 2. i thought this has face detection. i mean it does, but i don't know how to activate it.. it doesn't do the white/gray boxes over faces, how do i do that?</content>
