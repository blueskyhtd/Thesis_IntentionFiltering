		<content>hello all. i currently have the canon sd800is. while its a great camera, i'm still not pleased w/ the picture quality, especially coming from the a95. i recently purchased the sd550 on ebay for a bargain of $160 in mint condition. besides the image stabilization, is there really a diff in picture quality between the two pocket cams? i know the sd550 has a bigger sensor so will that make a noticeable difference? thanks!</content>
