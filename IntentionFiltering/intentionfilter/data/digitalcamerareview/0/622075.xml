		<content>just bought an s5 is because my s1 didn't have a macro mode. seems no matter what i try i can't get the 'flower' to show up in the lcd window. i have tried touching the 'flower macro button' on the side of the lens umpteen times. camera is set in auto mode.... have read the manual which seems a little vague using macro so am wondering if i am missing something here. not only can't i get the flower to show in the lcd monitor...but i really bought this camera because i need it to focus within 2" and was told this camera had a super-macro to do just that. hoping someone can jump in here to point me in the right direction. thanks, liane</content>
