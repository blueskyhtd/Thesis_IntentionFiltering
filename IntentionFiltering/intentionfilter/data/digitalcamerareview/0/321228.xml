		<content>i have a canon sd960is. the zoom is in the same location as the shutter button but you push it left or right to zoom in or out. i'm thinking that i must have gotten something on in when i went out a few weeks ago. it's never been hard to press back and forth but now it's very difficult. i'm wondering if it would be safe to get a wet q-tip or something and try to clean it... also there's a lot of times when i go to take a picture and i hold the shutter button down and the red light comes on like it's going to take the picture but it won't. sometimes i even have to do this two or three times before it will finally take the picture. it's very annoying, especially for the price i paid for this. i have a cheaper digital elf i bought a few years ago that takes pictures way faster.</content>
