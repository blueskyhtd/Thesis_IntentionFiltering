		<content>have jsut bought a canon 30d and there is a spot on my camera. the lenses are clean and even when i switch lenses the exactly same spot apears in the same place. the mirror is also clean. at a close focal length this is nearly exactly round and at a different focal lenght it apears as a very dark small blob? could this be the sensor? any ideas? any help? thanks</content>
