		<content>hi folks, i've got the ixus 950 is (aka sd850 is)  whenever i use the in built red eye correction function i'm unable to copy the photos from the camera. has anyone also encountered this or better yet have a solution for this? alternatively, as a work around can anyone suggest some software for reducing/removing red eye from photos? ps. i'm using a genuine 4gb sandisk sdhc card. thanks.</content>
