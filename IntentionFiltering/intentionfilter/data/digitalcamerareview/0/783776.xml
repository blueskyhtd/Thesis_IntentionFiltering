		<content>hello, i'm new to the world of canon. previous camera's have been sony's. i just bought the sd700 is and notice an extra compartment inside the camera. it looks like it could store another battery. but by looking at it, the only way i would be able to slide a battery in that compartment is if i take apart the camera, which i don't want to do. is this common with all canon sd camera's? my question is can i utilize that extra battery compartment with a second battery? thanks in advance, patrick (newbie)</content>
