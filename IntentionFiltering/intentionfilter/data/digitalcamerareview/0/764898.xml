		<content>so after some research i decided to shoot in raw, and at first it was ok. i was able to import and edit my pictures using picasa, lightroom, and picnik. now though i can't seem to import my photo at all. picasa give me error message. lightroom say there is no picture, and when i open the camera in my computer there is no files, which before there was. i'm not sure what is happening. i'm using a canon rebel xs by the way. much help would be appreciated. also the last time i tried i was able to download the pictures using adobe bridge on my school computer. is this a memory card problem or a computer one? i hope this is not a camera problem or i am screw.</content>
