		<content>hello all, i just dumped my a630 in favor of the s5. overall i find it to be a super camera. fast operation, is, great rotating screen, aa batteries, 12x zoom, relatively fast lens, many many manual controls, decent size for it's class, movie mode w/ stereo recording, zooming, and ability to take pictures, hotshoe should i need one. picture quality is quite good, but unless i'm imagining, it is slightly less than the a630. however, i'm going to wait before i issue a ruling, as i haven't taken enough pics yet. i'll post more when i have some more thoughts!</content>
