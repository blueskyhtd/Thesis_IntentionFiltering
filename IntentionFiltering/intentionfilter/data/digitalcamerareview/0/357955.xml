		<content>hello, i upgraded from a canon power shot a1100is to a canon power shot sx30 is. will installing the new software for the sx30 is overwrite the software for the a1100 is and if so, can i still upload photos from the a1100 is. i would like to continue using this camera also but am concerned the new software wouldn't be compatible. thank you.</content>
