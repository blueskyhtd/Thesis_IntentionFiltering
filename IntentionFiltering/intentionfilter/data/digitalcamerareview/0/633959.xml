		<content>hi, i bought a canon sx30. i'm running windows xp - a custom install. when i connect the camera to the computer using a usb cable windows detects the camera but cannot find the drivers for the camera. there are no drivers on the canon cd - only camera software. yes, i did install the cd software before plugging in the camera. windows can't even find drivers online. i can't find any drivers on the canon websites either. any suggestions? i'm stuck. thanks.</content>
