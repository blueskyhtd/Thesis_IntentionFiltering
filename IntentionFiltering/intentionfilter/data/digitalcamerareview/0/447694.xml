		<content>when i put the s60 camera is "auto" mode it displays the movie icon and when i press the shoot button it takes a video clip movie rather than a picture. i've tried re-setting everything to factory/default settings (by holding down the menu button) but it still won't take pictures (only video) in "auto" mode. does anyone know how to fix this? thanks very much.</content>
