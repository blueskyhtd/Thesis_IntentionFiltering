		<content>hi, i bought a new canon sx110is 2 weeks ago. when placing my fully charged energizer nimh 2500mah batteries in it, i get the low battery signal right away. when placing the same batteries in my old sony digital cameras, the battery indicator shows they are fully charged... is this a problem with my canon or the batteries?</content>
