		<content>i love my s3. it takes great shots with lots of light available. however, i need to shoot my sons in high school sports-football and track--at night, under stadium lights. the shots are blurry, and i've been told i need a rebel xti. spending that kind of cash, and sitting in crowded bleachers is just not my idea of fun. any advice would be welcome. maybe i am not using the settings correctly? thanks!</content>
