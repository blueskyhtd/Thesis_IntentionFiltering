		<content>i have a canon sd1000. the thing is that the picture i see from the lcd is different from the snapped photo. it's like the camera has somehow an intelligence to change the colors of what is real and natural. how do i make my camera capture the naturalness of the scene? for example, tonight, i tried to take the evening scene, and i tried changed to night options, cloudy options, played with white balance etc, but it gave a brighter sky than what the lcd panel was showing.</content>
