		<content>hi there i just bought a powershot 4500 and i use the camera window programm to download pictures onto my hard drive. the problem is, when i connect by usb, it doesnt give me the option to start up camera window. i need to manually open the program (through start --> program) in order to download. is there a way to have the computer connect via usb to the camera and have the pop-up show the camera window program? thanks!</content>
