		<content>just bought a canon sd1400. when getting ready to take a photo, the camera is trying to focus and keeps making a 'ticking' noise. it seems like this is taking way too long. i am pressing down half way as instructed on all these p  s cameras. is this normal for the sd1400...anyone have one and know this??</content>
