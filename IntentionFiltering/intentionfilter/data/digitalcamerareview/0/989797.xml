		<content>i got a canon powershot a95 a couple years ago, to take with me when i went studying abroad. in the beginning, the camera took reasonable quality photos - nothing spectacular - but since last year or so, the image quality has reduced drastically. i don't know much about digital cameras, since i am a film guy...any help on what to do would be great (or even just telling me to throw the piece of junk out). thanks.</content>
