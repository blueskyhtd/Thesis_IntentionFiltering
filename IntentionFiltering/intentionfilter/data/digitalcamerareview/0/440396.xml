		<content>just bought a used canon powershot s2 off e-bay. i'm trying to format the memory card. when i scroll through to select the "format" mode, it is blacked out and i can't select it. i've tried two different cards, one a universal and one a canon (from previous camera) and neither will work. did i just get screwed or am i missing something?</content>
