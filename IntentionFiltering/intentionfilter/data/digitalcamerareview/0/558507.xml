		<content>hello, i recently bought a canon ixus 65, powershot sd630. as i'm fairly new to digital photography and i had problems with the lens on a kodak easyshare v530 (it wouldn't retract anymore) i would like to ask if it is normal that the lens on the canon makes a light mechanical or rattling sound when you focus on an object? i might be looking for problems that aren't there, but i would really like to be sure that this camera is 100% ok. thanks for any help. kind regards, peter</content>
