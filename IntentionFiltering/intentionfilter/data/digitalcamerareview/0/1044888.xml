		<content>i bought a canon powershot sx30 and the lcd randomly inverts the colours (i.e. all blacks turn white, reds turn blue, etc...). if i turn off the camera and turn it on again it's fine. also, periodically, the lcd stops working properly, as in if i am trying to scroll through photos, or even take a photo, only the top 1/4 inch refreshes with the new image. the rest stays frozen (sometimes inverting the colours as well). this seems like a real problem, but could it be a random setting that i accidentally hit? i haven't changed any settings since i took it out of thte box other than put it into shutter priority!</content>
