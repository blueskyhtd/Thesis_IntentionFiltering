		<content>is this normal behavior? in composition mode, the lcd screen shows vertical lines and anomalies when there is a bright spot such as glare or very high contrast such as a bright window in a darker room. the lines do not show up in the recorded picture, just in the viewscreen during composition. i have two of these cameras and both exhibit the same problem. canon support was useless.</content>
