		<content>i am pretty new to photography  have a couple questions. i am using a canon sx30is to take close up shots of rare coins. i have experimented with the camera's macro mode and manual focus but i keep getting grainy, washed out pics w/o much detail. the camera is on a tripod, approximately 6-8 inches from the subject  i am using a light tent for diffusion and two external white lights. i suspect the problem has to do with camera settings but i know very little about how to set up a camera for those conditions. can someone suggest how to set up the sx30is for sharp, detailed close ups? thanks.</content>
