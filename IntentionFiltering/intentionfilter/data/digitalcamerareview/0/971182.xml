		<content>last weekend, after using the zoom on this camera, the zoom got stuck, i.e. the lens wouldn't retract. when i tried pressing the on/off button the viewfinder just flashed briefly, so i couldn't take any more shots. about 24 hours later, when i pressed the button again, the lens did retract, but i still couldn't get the camera to turn on. about 4 days later, when i tried again, everything seems ok. has anyone else had this problem? should i get the camera looked at by an expert?</content>
