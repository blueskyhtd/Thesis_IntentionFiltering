		<content>love it! along with my compact zooms and a dslr, i've owned a casio ex-z750 and ex-z1050. i loved the 750, but the 1050 was a big disappointment in the image department. i find that detail is fuzzy and the exposures can be inconsistent. it's still a good snapshop camera, so i gave it to a friend in need. after being a lot more careful in comparing and looking at actual images posted around the web i chose the sd950 . here are some video reviews: http://www.infoborder.com/digital_ca...hotsd950is.php boy, am i happy with this camera! everything i've taken so far has been great - from inside flash shots to outside panoramas and macro shots. what a terrific all-around compact camera. it won't replace my other cameras, but makes a great camera i can take anywhere and depend on getting really good images. i can't say enough good things about it. problems: i wish the battery could be charged without taking it out of the camera - casio's docking cameras were really great.</content>
