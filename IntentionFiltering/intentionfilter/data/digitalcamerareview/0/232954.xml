		<content>my mom bought a canon powershot s5 is, and shortly after she bought it, the print/share button blue light started staying lit constantly, unless the batteries are taken out. unfortunately, this tends to drain the batteries a lot faster, obviously. is there a setting to turn that light off when it's not plugged into a printer, or does it need to be serviced? i've searched a lot of places online and can't find any mention of this problem. i even tried plugging the camera into her hp photosmart printer and printed a photo, but that didn't fix anything. any help is appreciated. thanks</content>
