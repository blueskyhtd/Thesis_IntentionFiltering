		<content>i purchased a lens adapter for my new g12 with the thought that it might be a way to protect the lens and be a bit of a lens hood. i know, the filter adapter fa-dc58b would be a better choice - it is on order. using the la i interestingly found that at the g12 widest lens setting, the hood clipped the image. also i found the la comes in two parts - anyone know why that is? i haven't found anything about that in the sparse document canon sent with the la. thanks, tom</content>
