		<content>hi all! i recently got a new canon powershot sd780 is as a gift and so far i love it. the only problem i am having is that sometimes it seems as though the images that are printed out are a bit off centered (either side to side or up and down) from what is displayed on the screen. any idea what could be causing this or how to fix it? i don't know much about the customized settings and always use my camera on the auto options. any help would be much appreciated! thanks!</content>
