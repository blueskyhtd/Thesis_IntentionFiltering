		<content>hi i am new and hope that i have posted this request in the correct place. i have a 350d and bought it just after they were released to replace the 300d with two batteries. i have excellent service from the camera but this last month it has started to behave oddly. i have had error 99 which the book indicates is a battery problem but this is intermitent. the flash tends to operate on a delay and flashes a number of times before firing. the display indicates that the battery is fully charged. does anyone know if this is a battery problem (in my case two batteries) or is it something to do with the camera and potentially more serious? many thanks is advance alan south coast uk.</content>
