		<content>i just bought the rebel t3 bundle with 18x55 and 75x300 lenses. is there a power zoom on this camera? i can zoom manually and take a picture but when i try to use the zoom buttons it takes the picture from the original view. i have checked the manual and google and i just can't figure it out.</content>
