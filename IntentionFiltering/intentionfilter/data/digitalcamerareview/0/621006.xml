		<content>my newest set of canon cameras, that i have accumulated over the years is a a570 is. i have to admit that i do find the a series having excellent value. here is my question: will i get more accurate photos by looking at my lcd display instead of my viewfinder ?? i much prefer the view finder, from years of taking photos as well as the ability to block out other views. i think that looking at the lcd is always better for close up shots ??? true ?? please help me. i am having a quasi-debate with my son. thanks, jon temple</content>
