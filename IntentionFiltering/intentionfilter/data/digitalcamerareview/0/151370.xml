		<content>has anyone experienced trouble with their 50mm lens "sticking" at the wide apeture? i am pretty new to all of this. i have a fixed 50mm lens that i can not adjust the apeture beyond 1.8/2.0. i see the "bulb" signal in my view finder. has anyone experienced this or know how to fix this problem before i go out to seek help and have the lense inspected? i have a rebel xti. in any of the settings -manual, tv, av or auto - the lense will not adjust beyond 2.0 help - as this is my favorite lense!!! thank you.</content>
