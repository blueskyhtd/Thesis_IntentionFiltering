		<content>i bought a canon s60 in 2005 and it worked great until yesterday. now the images have a pink hue, some (but not all) have a line across the middle, and the objects, such as furniture, appear to have a "fringed" edge. any suggestion about what could be causing this and how to fix it?</content>
