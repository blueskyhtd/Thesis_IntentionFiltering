		<content>i have a 3 year old canon powershot a85. it was working fine until recently it's screen started to flicker. it only happens while taking a picture, there are lines and the display is not still but keeps flickering. this happens for 4-5 minutes and then it goes away. the pictures come out fine though. does anyone know why this might be happening? is this camera dying?</content>
