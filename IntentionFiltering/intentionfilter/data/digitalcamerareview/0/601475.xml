		<content>was on the forums in the kodak area. bought a v1253; it broke in a week. got a second one and it lasted just a little longer. don't want to trash a mfg but, will say i am much happier with my canon sd950is. is a great camera! looking forward to being a part of this forum and learning from you all. alan</content>
