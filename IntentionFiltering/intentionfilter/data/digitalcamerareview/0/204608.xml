		<content>i purchased the canon powershot sd870 is camera before christmas. so our family christmas celebrations were the first shots i took on the camera. when i got the pictures back, there were mysterious white spots on many of the pictures. sometimes they were tiny - pen head size - and other times they were the size of a dime. they moved around - they were never in the same place in any of the photos so i didn't think there was just a spot on the lens. i exchanged the camera thinking there was an issue, but the same model i brought home today appears to be doing the same thing. i haven't developed the photos yet, but i can see on the lcd where there are small white spots on a few of the photos. i use the auto mode - i haven't changed any of the settings on the camera. so the flash is on with most of the photos since i have been taking inside shots. have you ever heard of this problem and what am i doing wrong?!</content>
