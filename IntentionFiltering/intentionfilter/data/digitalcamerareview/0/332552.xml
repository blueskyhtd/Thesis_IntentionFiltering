		<content>i bought a used canon rebel xt slr that is about 3 or 4 years old that has taken about 5000 pictures by now. my model looks shorter and wider than in real life. do i need a different lens ( i currently have a efs 18-55mm)? it also seems to exaggerate this outcome when i turn it sideways.</content>
