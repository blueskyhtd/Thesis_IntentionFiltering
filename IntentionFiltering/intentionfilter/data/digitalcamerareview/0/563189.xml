		<content>i just got the canon rebel xs digital camera, and i started using it today after reading the manual. i mostly got the camera to take photos of dogs, mine and others - that are always in motion. i put the camera in auto mode, and it won't let me do continuous shooting. i put it in sports mode and i can do continuous shooting, but the pictures come out all blurry. the flash doesn't go off in that mode. it won't let me pop the flash up. how can i take nice, clear pictures of dogs that are running indoors (i'll be taking lots of pictures at rescue parties, etc) with this camera? what steps should i do? i'm just a beginner with slr cameras, so this is all new to me.</content>
