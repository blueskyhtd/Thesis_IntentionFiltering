		<content>i am having a few potential issues with my camera. -when i move the camera when its off, i hear a sound as if there is a loose screw rolling around inside. could it be something else? -when the camera is on and i am zooming i hear this flickering sound. i think it might be the auto focus adjusting. any ideas? bear in mind this is my first digital camera so i am not familiar with the usual sounds of a digital camera. thanks alot</content>
