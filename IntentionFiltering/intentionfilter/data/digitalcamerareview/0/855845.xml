		<content>my camera has been sitting on my desk, untouched for a few weeks now. last time i used it, it was for my review on nbr. i go to use my camera, and there is no image??! everything else works. i can take a picture, (but it just shows up black) i look on the display, and i can see the items like pics left, but no image. i call canon, and they didn't know what to do (since we tried everything) so im about to send it in. today i go to turn it on, and now it doesnt even turn on. so, i hope i get this one fixed, or just a new one. why would this happen though?</content>
