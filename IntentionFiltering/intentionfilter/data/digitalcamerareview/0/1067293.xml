		<content>i got a canon rebel xti for my birthday and admittedly don't know much about it. i keep jamming up my photo program when i try to download pictures from the camera. the pictures are very large when downloaded. is there a setting on the camera to reduce the size of the photos? thanks so much! binkie</content>
