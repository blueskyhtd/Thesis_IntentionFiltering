		<content>i have read many reviews on these cameras. i currently have a canon ps for my purse that i will keep. i have a canon sx 20 is that i really like but was considering the following: canon sx 30 is-i like my sx 20 because the zoom is great and i am sure the zoom on the 30 is even better...advice? or canon eos rebel t2i my question: can you use the lens that comes with the rebel 18-? as the normal lens that you would take normal (ie. in the house or yard pics of your kids) pictures? suggestions? thanks so much for any advice/suggestions!!!</content>
