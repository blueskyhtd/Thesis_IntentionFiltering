		<content>i have a canon powershot s410. i got it about 3 years ago, and i have the battery that came with it and also an extra one that i bought at the same time. they used to work fine, but lately i have noticed that they don't seem to hold charge very well. i made sure to charge them fully, but then they only last for a couple pictures before running out. does this usually happen after a few years? i want to replace them but i want to be sure that it is the batteries that are the cause of the problem, as opposed to the camera itself, or the charger.</content>
