		<content>just purchased this camera. do you think the battery will last a day or shooting pictures, say on vacation? will i need to recharge every day? i had a nikon a few years ago that ate batteries, it was horrible. i'm hoping this new canon will be better. this may be a simple question, but not very camera savy here</content>
