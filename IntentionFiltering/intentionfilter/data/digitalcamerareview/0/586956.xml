		<content>hi all! just got the a570 is, ordered it from amazon. on the front around the lens there is a plastic donut type thing attached to the body (theres a little button in front you can click to rotate it and take it off, exposing the sides of the lense). this thing is kind of loose on mine. i wanted to check to see if this is true of all a570is's, or if this is just the case with mine (in which case i should probably return it). what i mean by loose is... it's loose, when you tap it it moves. i'm not sure what function the thing servs, or why it deserves a button to take it off, but its looseness is rather disturbing as it rattles whenever i pick the camera up. thanks in advance darunium</content>
