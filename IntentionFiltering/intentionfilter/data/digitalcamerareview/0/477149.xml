		<content>can anyone give me ideas? i just bought a canon sd200 is from best buy in a bundle with camera, canon deluxe leather case, 4.0 gb sdhc card, and an extra nb-6l batery for $199.99, and would hate to lose the bundle. i love the color accent reture on my mom's sd1100 is, but is has been removed from the sd1200 is. is there any free software i can download that will do the same thing? i don't want to take back the camera back because of this feture loss.</content>
