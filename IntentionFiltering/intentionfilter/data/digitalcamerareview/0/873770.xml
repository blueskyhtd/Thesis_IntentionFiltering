		<content>okay, so i went on a trip to san francisco, took about 300+ pics on my kingston card, then the batteries died. afterwards it said that the card was full, yet when i tried to review the photos, the buffer light would flash for a while before returning with "no images". looking through the format option, i found that it recognized 890 mb currently being used. i did not format. now that i'm home, my computer won't even read the card. when i insert it into my computer's sd slot, the autoplay buffer box comes onto the screen, then nothing. i try exploring it only to find that it doesn't recognize the card to even be present. anybody have help/suggestions?</content>
