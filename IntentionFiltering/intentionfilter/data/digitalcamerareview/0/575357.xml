		<content>is there anyway to turn off the self-timer lamp, the blinking orange light that goes off when one uses the self-timer. i've tried turning off the red eye and af-assist beam, but the self timer lamp is still active. is there anyway to deactivate the light while still being able to use the self-timer, it's just annoying when useing the camera, with the self-timer, in a dark, crowded room. thank you</content>
