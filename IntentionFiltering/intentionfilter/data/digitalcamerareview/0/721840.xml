		<content>i knew the lcd screen on the canon a720is didn't have good resolution (115,000 pixels) but i've discovered that it also doesn't show decent color. the colors are incorrect - for example red looks like red/orange. also, the colors appear washed out. fortunately, the colors look great on the computer screen. anyone notice this? do i have a defective lcd screen?</content>
