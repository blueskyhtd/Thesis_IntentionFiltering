		<content>hello, i don't know where to ask, hope anyone can answer here. i did what's written in the camera manual in safety precautions. i pointed my camera directly at the bright light source, i don't know what is ccd but it's probably damaged cause now in low light (normal electric light indoors) conditions pics without flash and videos quality is like this: is it permanent damage or what can be done in such case? camera is canon tx1. i'd appreciate any advice</content>
