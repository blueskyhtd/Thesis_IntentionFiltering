		<content>hi, i bought canon powershot - g7 recently. the qulaity is superb but i have a small doubt. when the camera is on and ready to shoot..if i move/tilt it horizantally so that the lcd screen goes up and down i observe small crackling sound. the sound is something like hard disk operational sound. is it some kind of problem....thanks a lot in advance</content>
