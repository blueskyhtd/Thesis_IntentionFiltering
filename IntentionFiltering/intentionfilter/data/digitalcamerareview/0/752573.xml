		<content>i recently got a canon sd 600. while it takes great close-up photos using the macro digital feature, my photos of fast-moving objects is less than great. i attempted to photograph aircraft departing but each photo blurred. i am unable to set shutter speed. also, the shutter lag caused me to miss several shots, although i set it on continuous shooting. any advice?</content>
