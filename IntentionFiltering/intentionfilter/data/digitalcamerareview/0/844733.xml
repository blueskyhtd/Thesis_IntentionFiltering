		<content>just wondering if there is anything i can do about fuzzy video. i bought the camera partly to get better video than my way old kodak easyshare (2 mp and 15fps) but this isn't. when i pause the playback movement is blurred, even with recording hd at 30fps. anyone else notice this and is there some setting that will sharpen up the video?</content>
