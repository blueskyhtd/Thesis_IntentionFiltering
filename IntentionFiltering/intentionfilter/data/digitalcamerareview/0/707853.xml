		<content>i just got my first digital camera, canon sd 600. i was using it when suddenly a message appeared saying that the memory card was full. do any digital cameras advise when the card is nearly full? i know my camcorders all give a 5-minute warning when the tape supply is low. also, is it necessary to format (customize) memory cards before use? what is the purpose and what happens if i forget to format a new card? if a memory card is ejected, then re-inserted, won't formatting erase everything? the manual gives little information about formatting.</content>
