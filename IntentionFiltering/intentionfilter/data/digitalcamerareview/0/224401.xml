		<content>hi all- first post here. i just got a canon rebel t2i (i'm completely new to the camera world) but am eager to figure this out and get going! i like to think i'm a quick learner! i guess my first question is... is there a free video tutorial anywhere to walk me through everything? i have searched online and haven't really found anything except reviews and maybe some tutorials, but they aren't very in depth. my second question is- i had the ca mode all figured out and was having fun playing with the blurred background option. but now when i go there, the background option is faded and it won't let me adjust it at all. anyone know what is causing this? thank you for your help!</content>
