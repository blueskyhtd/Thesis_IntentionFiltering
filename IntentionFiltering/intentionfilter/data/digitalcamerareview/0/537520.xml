		<content>hi my online research tells me that all those black dots on my images are dust on the sensor and it is cheaper to just buy a new one rather than sending it in for cleaning. i will appreciate any confirmation from experts here. the attached image is zoomed at 3x. without zooming i get the spot on the right corner only. i feel bad as going through my pics i traced it back to a month before the end of the 1yr warranty. my cc covers the 2yr but canon-canada has to verify this is a job that would have been under warranty.</content>
