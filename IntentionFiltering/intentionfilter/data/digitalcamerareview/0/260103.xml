		<content>i have a eos digital rebel that is about 2 years old. i always set my camera image quality to large/fine which saves images at 300dpi. for some reason my images are now saving at 180dpi - but the setting is still large/fine. has anyone had a similiar problem? how can i get back to a high resolution image?</content>
