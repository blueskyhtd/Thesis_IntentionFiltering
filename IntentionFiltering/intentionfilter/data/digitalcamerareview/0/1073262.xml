		<content>have just bought an ixus 800is and been playing around. just wondering if anyone can point me to a detailed guide on the use of the various scene modes, as well as the macro function. i understand the basics but wanted more in depth review, eg if taking a picture of someone's face, do i use portrait alone or do i use portrait as well as the macro function. thanks in advance</content>
