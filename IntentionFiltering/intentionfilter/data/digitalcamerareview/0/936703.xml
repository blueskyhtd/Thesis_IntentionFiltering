		<content>when i use "high speed burst" and shoot a half-dozen photos, then look at the pictures, only the first picture is shown. i switched "group images" to "off." i downloaded the photos to iphoto and only the first photo of each burst downloads. i read the manual and followed the steps but i can't get this feature to work. any suggestions?</content>
