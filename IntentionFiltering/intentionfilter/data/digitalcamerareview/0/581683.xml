		<content>i just bought the la-dc 58g lens adapter and a conversion ring ( 58-55mm) to go with my canon a710is camera. i have a set of vivitar 55mm close-up lenses ( 4-2-1) which i have used on my older minota xd-11, but i would like to see how they work on my new camera. if i use these regular lenses in the 'manual' mode, what kind of problems will i encounter? will i be able to get any satisfactory results ? i would like to try these lenses before spending money on the canon macro lens 250d. john</content>
