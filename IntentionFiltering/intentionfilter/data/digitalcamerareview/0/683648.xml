		<content>hi, i've lost my canon installation cd (don't know where, don't know when, but i no longer have it ). i don't need any of the cr_p on the cd except the photostitch to make panoramic pictures. could anyone provide me (in a legal fashion) with a copy of the software / iso of the powershot a95 installation cd? since i own the camera i am entitled to a copy of photostitch... on the support website only updates are available, not the installation kits themselves. alternatively, can anyone point me to a good replacement software? (freeware preferably). thanks, e.b.e. edit: oh by the way powershot a95 is a fine machine had one in a car accident once, the lcd backcover is bent and the zoom mechanism clicks sometimes, but it's still working nevertheless. 4 bad pixels on the ccd but that's to be expected after 1.5 years i presume.</content>
