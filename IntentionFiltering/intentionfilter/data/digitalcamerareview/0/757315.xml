		<content>i recently purchased an sx30 as a second camera. wow its one heck of a bang for the buck. but it has a strange problem..... when i review photos for longer than 60 seconds, and then press the key to go back to shooting mode the camera shuts off. if i review photos for 30 seconds this doesn't happen. is this a design feature, a design flaw, or a problem with my camera? thx</content>
