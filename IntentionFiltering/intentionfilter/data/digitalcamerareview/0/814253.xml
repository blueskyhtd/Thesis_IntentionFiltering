		<content>hi - i've recently bought a 1000d (rebel xs) and a zeikos 680ex ettl flash. the flash worked great the first time i put it on the camera. now, it doesn't fire. the flash ready light never comes on, the built-in works if i take the zeikos off. menu settings have external enabled and ttl mode set. i'm new to digital, but am an experienced 35mm guy. please help. thanks.</content>
