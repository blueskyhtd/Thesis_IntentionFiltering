		<content>i purchased a canon powershot sd1300 digital camera a couple of days ago. i've taken some lovely pictures with it, and i'm enjoying it very much. a strange thing happens with the video though. the picture is nice and clear (though a wee bit jerky) and the sound is very good, but the two things don't match up: the picture lags a little behind the sound. is this something i can fix, or is it just the way this particular camera shoots video? please advise. thanks, vitaluna</content>
