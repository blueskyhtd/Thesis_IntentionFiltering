		<title>file numbering on canon cameras</title>

		<content>i just got a canon sx100 is and have a quesiton about file numbering. years ago, i had a canon a20. apparently for canons, you can number the folders on the memory cards, but i don't see any way to influence the file names. for example, in 2003 i have file names on my pc from my a20 named img_0001.jpg and so on. i take a photo today with the sx100 is, and the file name is also img_0001.jpg. i don't want to ever screw up and overwrite old photos just because of the name change. is there a way to change that prefix to make, for example, img10001.jpg or imga0001.jpg or something like that? thanks!</content>
