		<content>i'm a point  shot guy with very little camera savvy. that's why i bought a ps i can't seem to get those crisp clear pics that i used to get when i first bought the camera. anything relatively close up comes out blurry and none of my pics have that - jump out off the page - quality that i've seen with you folks. i'm very camera techno challenged ........... oh yeah...... is there a way i can download a copy of my users manual? i only have the spanish one...... thanks tommy</content>
