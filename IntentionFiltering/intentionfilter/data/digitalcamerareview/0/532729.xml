		<content>i have had my camera for 2 days, it was fedexed from beach camera. when on, there are glowing spots on the lcd that are hazy and purple, about the size of half a pea. they are just right of center. when i turn the camera off, the spots glow green for a second before turning totally off. is it worth packing it back up and returning it? the lcd is clean, no fingerprints. i just do not know if these spots will get worse.</content>
