		<content>i am surprised that my camera model, canon sd 600, is not listed on digital camera review. is there a reason? other 2006 models are listed. i also need to know how i can get a faster shutter speed when i try to capture fast-moving objects. these shots blur. there is no shutter control. when trying to capture an image off a crt tv screen, the result is a half-darkened image. any advice?</content>
